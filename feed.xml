      <title>CORG: Generating Answers from Complex, Interrelated Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00023</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.00023.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Hyunji Lee, Franck Dernoncourt, Trung Bui, Seunghyun Yoon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; In a real-world corpus, knowledge frequently recurs across documents but often contains inconsistencies due to ambiguous naming, outdated information, or errors, leading to complex interrelationships between contexts. Previous research has shown that language models struggle with these complexities, typically focusing on single factors in isolation. We classify these relationships into four types: distracting, ambiguous, counterfactual, and duplicated. Our analysis reveals that no single approach effectively addresses all these interrelationships simultaneously. Therefore, we introduce Context Organizer (CORG), a framework that organizes multiple contexts into independently processed groups. This design allows the model to efficiently find all relevant answers while ensuring disambiguation. CORG consists of three key components: a graph constructor, a reranker, and an aggregator. Our results demonstrate that CORG balances performance and efficiency effectively, outperforming existing grouping methods and achieving comparable results to more computationally intensive, single-context approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PixelHacker: Image Inpainting with Structural and Semantic Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20438</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2504.20438.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ziyang Xu, Kangsheng Duan, Xiaolei Shen, Zhifeng Ding, Wenyu Liu, Xiaohu Ruan, Xiaoxin Chen, Xinggang Wang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 23&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Image inpainting is a fundamental research area between image editing and image generation. Recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods have explored novel attention mechanisms, lightweight architectures, and context-aware modeling, demonstrating impressive performance. However, they often struggle with complex structure (e.g., texture, shape, spatial relations) and semantics (e.g., color consistency, object restoration, and logical correctness), leading to artifacts and inappropriate generation. To address this challenge, we design a simple yet effective inpainting paradigm called latent categories guidance, and further propose a diffusion-based model named PixelHacker. Specifically, we first construct a large dataset containing 14 million image-mask pairs by annotating foreground and background (potential 116 and 21 categories, respectively). Then, we encode potential foreground and background representations separately through two fixed-size embeddings, and intermittently inject these features into the denoising process via linear attention. Finally, by pre-training on our dataset and fine-tuning on open-source benchmarks, we obtain PixelHacker. Extensive experiments show that PixelHacker comprehensively outperforms the SOTA on a wide range of datasets (Places2, CelebA-HQ, and FFHQ) and exhibits remarkable consistency in both structure and semantics.

      <title>X-Cross: Dynamic Integration of Language Models for Cross-Domain   Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20859</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2504.20859.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Guy Hadad, Haggai Roitman, Yotam Eshel, Bracha Shapira, Lior Rokach&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; As new products are emerging daily, recommendation systems are required to quickly adapt to possible new domains without needing extensive retraining. This work presents ``X-Cross'' -- a novel cross-domain sequential-recommendation model that recommends products in new domains by integrating several domain-specific language models; each model is fine-tuned with low-rank adapters (LoRA). Given a recommendation prompt, operating layer by layer, X-Cross dynamically refines the representation of each source language model by integrating knowledge from all other models. These refined representations are propagated from one layer to the next, leveraging the activations from each domain adapter to ensure domain-specific nuances are preserved while enabling adaptability across domains. Using Amazon datasets for sequential recommendation, X-Cross achieves performance comparable to a model that is fine-tuned with LoRA, while using only 25% of the additional parameters. In cross-domain tasks, such as adapting from Toys domain to Tools, Electronics or Sports, X-Cross demonstrates robust performance, while requiring about 50%-75% less fine-tuning data than LoRA to make fine-tuning effective. Furthermore, X-Cross achieves significant improvement in accuracy over alternative cross-domain baselines. Overall, X-Cross enables scalable and adaptive cross-domain recommendations, reducing computational overhead and providing an efficient solution for data-constrained environments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Beyond One-Size-Fits-All: Inversion Learning for Highly Effective NLG   Evaluation Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21117</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2504.21117.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Hanhua Hong, Chenghao Xiao, Yang Wang, Yiqi Liu, Wenge Rong, Chenghua Lin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 11&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems is challenging due to the diversity of valid outputs. While human evaluation is the gold standard, it suffers from inconsistencies, lack of standardisation, and demographic biases, limiting reproducibility. LLM-based evaluation offers a scalable alternative but is highly sensitive to prompt design, where small variations can lead to significant discrepancies. In this work, we propose an inversion learning method that learns effective reverse mappings from model outputs back to their input instructions, enabling the automatic generation of highly effective, model-specific evaluation prompts. Our method requires only a single evaluation sample and eliminates the need for time-consuming manual prompt engineering, thereby improving both efficiency and robustness. Our work contributes toward a new direction for more robust and efficient LLM-based evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Real-World Gaps in AI Governance Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00174</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.00174.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ilan Strauss, Isobel Moure, Tim O'Reilly, Sruly Rosenblat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Drawing on 1,178 safety and reliability papers from 9,439 generative AI papers (January 2020 - March 2025), we compare research outputs of leading AI companies (Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI) and AI universities (CMU, MIT, NYU, Stanford, UC Berkeley, and University of Washington). We find that corporate AI research increasingly concentrates on pre-deployment areas -- model alignment and testing &amp; evaluation -- while attention to deployment-stage issues such as model bias has waned. Significant research gaps exist in high-risk deployment domains, including healthcare, finance, misinformation, persuasive and addictive features, hallucinations, and copyright. Without improved observability into deployed AI, growing corporate concentration could deepen knowledge deficits. We recommend expanding external researcher access to deployment data and systematic observability of in-market AI behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>TeLoGraF: Temporal Logic Planning via Graph-encoded Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00562</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.00562.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yue Meng, Chuchu Fan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Learning to solve complex tasks with signal temporal logic (STL) specifications is crucial to many real-world applications. However, most previous works only consider fixed or parametrized STL specifications due to the lack of a diverse STL dataset and encoders to effectively extract temporal logic information for downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose TeLoGraF, Temporal Logic Graph-encoded Flow, which utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNN) encoder and flow-matching to learn solutions for general STL specifications. We identify four commonly used STL templates and collect a total of 200K specifications with paired demonstrations. We conduct extensive experiments in five simulation environments ranging from simple dynamical models in the 2D space to high-dimensional 7DoF Franka Panda robot arm and Ant quadruped navigation. Results show that our method outperforms other baselines in the STL satisfaction rate. Compared to classical STL planning algorithms, our approach is 10-100X faster in inference and can work on any system dynamics. Besides, we show our graph-encoding method's capability to solve complex STLs and robustness to out-distribution STL specifications.

The family comes in three sizes -- Nano (8B), Super (49B), and Ultra (253B) -- and performs competitively with state-of-the-art reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 while offering superior inference throughput and memory efficiency. In this report, we discuss the training procedure for these models, which entails using neural architecture search from Llama 3 models for accelerated inference, knowledge distillation, and continued pretraining, followed by a reasoning-focused post-training stage consisting of two main parts: supervised fine-tuning and large scale reinforcement learning. Llama-Nemotron models are the first open-source models to support a dynamic reasoning toggle, allowing users to switch between standard chat and reasoning modes during inference. To further support open research and facilitate model development, we provide the following resources: 1. We release the Llama-Nemotron reasoning models -- LN-Nano, LN-Super, and LN-Ultra -- under the commercially permissive NVIDIA Open Model License Agreement. 2. We release the complete post-training dataset: Llama-Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset. 3. We also release our training codebases: NeMo, NeMo-Aligner, and Megatron-LM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Improving Editability in Image Generation with Layer-wise Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01079</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.01079.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Daneul Kim, Jaeah Lee, Jaesik Park&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 18&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Most real-world image editing tasks require multiple sequential edits to achieve desired results. Current editing approaches, primarily designed for single-object modifications, struggle with sequential editing: especially with maintaining previous edits along with adapting new objects naturally into the existing content. These limitations significantly hinder complex editing scenarios where multiple objects need to be modified while preserving their contextual relationships. We address this fundamental challenge through two key proposals: enabling rough mask inputs that preserve existing content while naturally integrating new elements and supporting consistent editing across multiple modifications. Our framework achieves this through layer-wise memory, which stores latent representations and prompt embeddings from previous edits. We propose Background Consistency Guidance that leverages memorized latents to maintain scene coherence and Multi-Query Disentanglement in cross-attention that ensures natural adaptation to existing content. To evaluate our method, we present a new benchmark dataset incorporating semantic alignment metrics and interactive editing scenarios. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate superior performance in iterative image editing tasks with minimal user effort, requiring only rough masks while maintaining high-quality results throughout multiple editing steps.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
