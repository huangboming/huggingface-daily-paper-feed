      <title>Radial Attention: O(nlog n) Sparse Attention with Energy Decay for   Long Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19852</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2506.19852.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Xingyang Li, Muyang Li, Tianle Cai, Haocheng Xi, Shuo Yang, Yujun Lin, Lvmin Zhang, Songlin Yang, Jinbo Hu, Kelly Peng, Maneesh Agrawala, Ion Stoica, Kurt Keutzer, Song Han&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 26&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality video generation, but the additional temporal dimension significantly increases computational costs, making training and inference on long videos prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal Energy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish as spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical decay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we propose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with O(n log n) complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute density, which is significantly more efficient than standard O(n^2) dense attention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial Attention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to spatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal distance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend their generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9times speedup over the original dense attention. With minimal tuning, it enables video generation up to 4times longer while reducing training costs by up to 4.4times compared to direct fine-tuning and accelerating inference by up to 3.7times compared to dense attention inference.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>DiffuCoder: Understanding and Improving Masked Diffusion Models for Code   Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20639</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2506.20639.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Shansan Gong, Ruixiang Zhang, Huangjie Zheng, Jiatao Gu, Navdeep Jaitly, Lingpeng Kong, Yizhe Zhang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 17&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are compelling alternatives to autoregressive (AR) models because their denoising models operate over the entire sequence. The global planning and iterative refinement features of dLLMs are particularly useful for code generation. However, current training and inference mechanisms for dLLMs in coding are still under-explored. To demystify the decoding behavior of dLLMs and unlock their potential for coding, we systematically investigate their denoising processes and reinforcement learning (RL) methods. We train a 7B dLLM, DiffuCoder, on 130B tokens of code. Using this model as a testbed, we analyze its decoding behavior, revealing how it differs from that of AR models: (1) dLLMs can decide how causal their generation should be without relying on semi-AR decoding, and (2) increasing the sampling temperature diversifies not only token choices but also their generation order. This diversity creates a rich search space for RL rollouts. For RL training, to reduce the variance of token log-likelihood estimates and maintain training efficiency, we propose coupled-GRPO, a novel sampling scheme that constructs complementary mask noise for completions used in training. In our experiments, coupled-GRPO significantly improves DiffuCoder's performance on code generation benchmarks (+4.4\% on EvalPlus) and reduces reliance on AR causal during decoding. Our work provides deeper insight into the machinery of dLLM generation and offers an effective, diffusion-native RL training framework. https://github.com/apple/ml-diffucoder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>HumanOmniV2: From Understanding to Omni-Modal Reasoning with Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21277</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2506.21277.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Qize Yang, Shimin Yao, Weixuan Chen, Shenghao Fu, Detao Bai, Jiaxing Zhao, Boyuan Sun, Bowen Yin, Xihan Wei, Jingren Zhou&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; With the rapid evolution of multimodal large language models, the capacity to deeply understand and interpret human intentions has emerged as a critical capability, which demands detailed and thoughtful reasoning. In recent studies, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the challenges associated with adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain largely unaddressed. In this paper, we identify two issues in existing multimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and shortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model misinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut problem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs, directly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information. To tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with a clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This global context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking key multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the accurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a context reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy rewards. Additionally, to improve complex reasoning capability, we employ the LLM to assess the logical reward, determining whether the reasoning process successfully integrates multimodal information with logical methods. We also introduce a reasoning omni-modal benchmark, IntentBench, aimed at evaluating models in understanding complex human intentions and emotions. Our proposed method demonstrates advanced performance across multiple omni-modal benchmarks compared to other open-source omni-modal models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Data Efficacy for Language Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21545</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2506.21545.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yalun Dai, Yangyu Huang, Xin Zhang, Wenshan Wu, Chong Li, Wenhui Lu, Shijie Cao, Li Dong, Scarlett Li&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Data is fundamental to the training of language models (LM). Recent research has been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by selecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data filtering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To complement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance by optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively underexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering data efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training data organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data Selection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which considers both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the gradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a novel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model forgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the data efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly, various instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying degrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these instances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for data ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy can be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection. Therefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM training.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Peccavi: Visual Paraphrase Attack Safe and Distortion Free Image   Watermarking Technique for AI-Generated Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22960</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2506.22960.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Shreyas Dixit, Ashhar Aziz, Shashwat Bajpai, Vasu Sharma, Aman Chadha, Vinija Jain, Amitava Das&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; A report by the European Union Law Enforcement Agency predicts that by 2026, up to 90 percent of online content could be synthetically generated, raising concerns among policymakers, who cautioned that "Generative AI could act as a force multiplier for political disinformation. The combined effect of generative text, images, videos, and audio may surpass the influence of any single modality." In response, California's Bill AB 3211 mandates the watermarking of AI-generated images, videos, and audio. However, concerns remain regarding the vulnerability of invisible watermarking techniques to tampering and the potential for malicious actors to bypass them entirely. Generative AI-powered de-watermarking attacks, especially the newly introduced visual paraphrase attack, have shown an ability to fully remove watermarks, resulting in a paraphrase of the original image. This paper introduces PECCAVI, the first visual paraphrase attack-safe and distortion-free image watermarking technique. In visual paraphrase attacks, an image is altered while preserving its core semantic regions, termed Non-Melting Points (NMPs). PECCAVI strategically embeds watermarks within these NMPs and employs multi-channel frequency domain watermarking. It also incorporates noisy burnishing to counter reverse-engineering efforts aimed at locating NMPs to disrupt the embedded watermark, thereby enhancing durability. PECCAVI is model-agnostic. All relevant resources and codes will be open-sourced.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Confident Splatting: Confidence-Based Compression of 3D Gaussian   Splatting via Learnable Beta Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22973</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2506.22973.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; AmirHossein Naghi Razlighi, Elaheh Badali Golezani, Shohreh Kasaei&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; 3D Gaussian Splatting enables high-quality real-time rendering but often produces millions of splats, resulting in excessive storage and computational overhead. We propose a novel lossy compression method based on learnable confidence scores modeled as Beta distributions. Each splat's confidence is optimized through reconstruction-aware losses, enabling pruning of low-confidence splats while preserving visual fidelity. The proposed approach is architecture-agnostic and can be applied to any Gaussian Splatting variant. In addition, the average confidence values serve as a new metric to assess the quality of the scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate favorable trade-offs between compression and fidelity compared to prior work. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/amirhossein-razlighi/Confident-Splatting&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MusiXQA: Advancing Visual Music Understanding in Multimodal Large   Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23009</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2506.23009.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Jian Chen, Wenye Ma, Penghang Liu, Wei Wang, Tengwei Song, Ming Li, Chenguang Wang, Ruiyi Zhang, Changyou Chen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable visual reasoning abilities in natural images, text-rich documents, and graphic designs. However, their ability to interpret music sheets remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce MusiXQA, the first comprehensive dataset for evaluating and advancing MLLMs in music sheet understanding. MusiXQA features high-quality synthetic music sheets generated via MusiXTeX, with structured annotations covering note pitch and duration, chords, clefs, key/time signatures, and text, enabling diverse visual QA tasks. Through extensive evaluations, we reveal significant limitations of current state-of-the-art MLLMs in this domain. Beyond benchmarking, we developed Phi-3-MusiX, an MLLM fine-tuned on our dataset, achieving significant performance gains over GPT-based methods. The proposed dataset and model establish a foundation for future advances in MLLMs for music sheet understanding. Code, data, and model will be released upon acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MoCa: Modality-aware Continual Pre-training Makes Better Bidirectional   Multimodal Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23115</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2506.23115.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Haonan Chen, Hong Liu, Yuping Luo, Liang Wang, Nan Yang, Furu Wei, Zhicheng Dou&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 30&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Multimodal embedding models, built upon causal Vision Language Models (VLMs), have shown promise in various tasks. However, current approaches face three key limitations: the use of causal attention in VLM backbones is suboptimal for embedding tasks; scalability issues due to reliance on high-quality labeled paired data for contrastive learning; and limited diversity in training objectives and data. To address these issues, we propose MoCa, a two-stage framework for transforming pre-trained VLMs into effective bidirectional multimodal embedding models. The first stage, Modality-aware Continual Pre-training, introduces a joint reconstruction objective that simultaneously denoises interleaved text and image inputs, enhancing bidirectional context-aware reasoning. The second stage, Heterogeneous Contrastive Fine-tuning, leverages diverse, semantically rich multimodal data beyond simple image-caption pairs to enhance generalization and alignment. Our method addresses the stated limitations by introducing bidirectional attention through continual pre-training, scaling effectively with massive unlabeled datasets via joint reconstruction objectives, and utilizing diverse multimodal data for enhanced representation robustness. Experiments demonstrate that MoCa consistently improves performance across MMEB and ViDoRe-v2 benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results, and exhibits strong scalability with both model size and training data on MMEB.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>IR3D-Bench: Evaluating Vision-Language Model Scene Understanding as   Agentic Inverse Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23329</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2506.23329.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Parker Liu, Chenxin Li, Zhengxin Li, Yipeng Wu, Wuyang Li, Zhiqin Yang, Zhenyuan Zhang, Yunlong Lin, Sirui Han, Brandon Y. Feng&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at descriptive tasks, but whether they truly understand scenes from visual observations remains uncertain. We introduce IR3D-Bench, a benchmark challenging VLMs to demonstrate understanding through active creation rather than passive recognition. Grounded in the analysis-by-synthesis paradigm, IR3D-Bench tasks Vision-Language Agents (VLAs) with actively using programming and rendering tools to recreate the underlying 3D structure of an input image, achieving agentic inverse rendering through tool use. This "understanding-by-creating" approach probes the tool-using generative capacity of VLAs, moving beyond the descriptive or conversational capacity measured by traditional scene understanding benchmarks. We provide a comprehensive suite of metrics to evaluate geometric accuracy, spatial relations, appearance attributes, and overall plausibility. Initial experiments on agentic inverse rendering powered by various state-of-the-art VLMs highlight current limitations, particularly in visual precision rather than basic tool usage. IR3D-Bench, including data and evaluation protocols, is released to facilitate systematic study and development of tool-using VLAs towards genuine scene understanding by creating.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ella: Embodied Social Agents with Lifelong Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24019</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2506.24019.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Hongxin Zhang, Zheyuan Zhang, Zeyuan Wang, Zunzhe Zhang, Lixing Fang, Qinhong Zhou, Chuang Gan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce Ella, an embodied social agent capable of lifelong learning within a community in a 3D open world, where agents accumulate experiences and acquire knowledge through everyday visual observations and social interactions. At the core of Ella's capabilities is a structured, long-term multimodal memory system that stores, updates, and retrieves information effectively. It consists of a name-centric semantic memory for organizing acquired knowledge and a spatiotemporal episodic memory for capturing multimodal experiences. By integrating this lifelong memory system with foundation models, Ella retrieves relevant information for decision-making, plans daily activities, builds social relationships, and evolves autonomously while coexisting with other intelligent beings in the open world. We conduct capability-oriented evaluations in a dynamic 3D open world where 15 agents engage in social activities for days and are assessed with a suite of unseen controlled evaluations. Experimental results show that Ella can influence, lead, and cooperate with other agents well to achieve goals, showcasing its ability to learn effectively through observation and social interaction. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of combining structured memory systems with foundation models for advancing embodied intelligence.

      <title>FreeLong++: Training-Free Long Video Generation via Multi-band   SpectralFusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00162</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.00162.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yu Lu, Yi Yang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Recent advances in video generation models have enabled high-quality short video generation from text prompts. However, extending these models to longer videos remains a significant challenge, primarily due to degraded temporal consistency and visual fidelity. Our preliminary observations show that naively applying short-video generation models to longer sequences leads to noticeable quality degradation. Further analysis identifies a systematic trend where high-frequency components become increasingly distorted as video length grows, an issue we term high-frequency distortion. To address this, we propose FreeLong, a training-free framework designed to balance the frequency distribution of long video features during the denoising process. FreeLong achieves this by blending global low-frequency features, which capture holistic semantics across the full video, with local high-frequency features extracted from short temporal windows to preserve fine details. Building on this, FreeLong++ extends FreeLong dual-branch design into a multi-branch architecture with multiple attention branches, each operating at a distinct temporal scale. By arranging multiple window sizes from global to local, FreeLong++ enables multi-band frequency fusion from low to high frequencies, ensuring both semantic continuity and fine-grained motion dynamics across longer video sequences. Without any additional training, FreeLong++ can be plugged into existing video generation models (e.g. Wan2.1 and LTX-Video) to produce longer videos with substantially improved temporal consistency and visual fidelity. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods on longer video generation tasks (e.g. 4x and 8x of native length). It also supports coherent multi-prompt video generation with smooth scene transitions and enables controllable video generation using long depth or pose sequences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Training for X-Ray Vision: Amodal Segmentation, Amodal Content   Completion, and View-Invariant Object Representation from Multi-Camera Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00339</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.00339.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Alexander Moore, Amar Saini, Kylie Cancilla, Doug Poland, Carmen Carrano&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Amodal segmentation and amodal content completion require using object priors to estimate occluded masks and features of objects in complex scenes. Until now, no data has provided an additional dimension for object context: the possibility of multiple cameras sharing a view of a scene. We introduce MOVi-MC-AC: Multiple Object Video with Multi-Cameras and Amodal Content, the largest amodal segmentation and first amodal content dataset to date. Cluttered scenes of generic household objects are simulated in multi-camera video. MOVi-MC-AC contributes to the growing literature of object detection, tracking, and segmentation by including two new contributions to the deep learning for computer vision world. Multiple Camera (MC) settings where objects can be identified and tracked between various unique camera perspectives are rare in both synthetic and real-world video. We introduce a new complexity to synthetic video by providing consistent object ids for detections and segmentations between both frames and multiple cameras each with unique features and motion patterns on a single scene. Amodal Content (AC) is a reconstructive task in which models predict the appearance of target objects through occlusions. In the amodal segmentation literature, some datasets have been released with amodal detection, tracking, and segmentation labels. While other methods rely on slow cut-and-paste schemes to generate amodal content pseudo-labels, they do not account for natural occlusions present in the modal masks. MOVi-MC-AC provides labels for ~5.8 million object instances, setting a new maximum in the amodal dataset literature, along with being the first to provide ground-truth amodal content. The full dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Amar-S/MOVi-MC-AC ,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But as math leaderboards improve week by week, it is worth asking: do these gains reflect broader problem-solving ability or just narrow overfitting? To answer this question, we evaluate over 20 open-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including math, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard instruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in math fail to transfer their gains to other domains. To rigorously study this phenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using math-only data but different tuning methods. We find that reinforcement learning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities. Latent-space representation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT induces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves general-domain structure. Our results suggest a need to rethink standard post-training recipes, particularly the reliance on SFT-distilled data for advancing reasoning models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>FreNBRDF: A Frequency-Rectified Neural Material Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00476</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.00476.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Chenliang Zhou, Zheyuan Hu, Cengiz Oztireli&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Accurate material modeling is crucial for achieving photorealistic rendering, bridging the gap between computer-generated imagery and real-world photographs. While traditional approaches rely on tabulated BRDF data, recent work has shifted towards implicit neural representations, which offer compact and flexible frameworks for a range of tasks. However, their behavior in the frequency domain remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce FreNBRDF, a frequency-rectified neural material representation. By leveraging spherical harmonics, we integrate frequency-domain considerations into neural BRDF modeling. We propose a novel frequency-rectified loss, derived from a frequency analysis of neural materials, and incorporate it into a generalizable and adaptive reconstruction and editing pipeline. This framework enhances fidelity, adaptability, and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \ours improves the accuracy and robustness of material appearance reconstruction and editing compared to state-of-the-art baselines, enabling more structured and interpretable downstream tasks and applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mixture of Reasonings: Teach Large Language Models to Reason with   Adaptive Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00606</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.00606.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Tao Xiong, Xavier Hu, Wenyan Fan, Shengyu Zhang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Large language models (LLMs) excel in complex tasks through advanced prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT), but their reliance on manually crafted, task-specific prompts limits adaptability and efficiency. We introduce Mixture of Reasoning (MoR), a training framework that embeds diverse reasoning strategies into LLMs for autonomous, task-adaptive reasoning without external prompt engineering. MoR has two phases: Thought Generation, creating reasoning chain templates with models like GPT-4o, and SFT Dataset Construction, pairing templates with benchmark datasets for supervised fine-tuning.Our experiments show that MoR significantly enhances performance, with MoR150 achieving 0.730 (2.2% improvement) using CoT prompting and 0.734 (13.5% improvement) compared to baselines. MoR eliminates the need for task-specific prompts, offering a generalizable solution for robust reasoning across diverse tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Thinking Beyond Tokens: From Brain-Inspired Intelligence to Cognitive   Foundations for Artificial General Intelligence and its Societal Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00951</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.00951.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Rizwan Qureshi, Ranjan Sapkota, Abbas Shah, Amgad Muneer, Anas Zafar, Ashmal Vayani, Maged Shoman, Abdelrahman B. M. Eldaly, Kai Zhang, Ferhat Sadak, Shaina Raza, Xinqi Fan, Ravid Shwartz-Ziv, Hong Yan, Vinjia Jain, Aman Chadha, Manoj Karkee, Jia Wu, Philip Torr, Seyedali Mirjalili&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Can machines truly think, reason and act in domains like humans? This enduring question continues to shape the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Despite the growing capabilities of models such as GPT-4.5, DeepSeek, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Phi-4, and Grok 3, which exhibit multimodal fluency and partial reasoning, these systems remain fundamentally limited by their reliance on token-level prediction and lack of grounded agency. This paper offers a cross-disciplinary synthesis of AGI development, spanning artificial intelligence, cognitive neuroscience, psychology, generative models, and agent-based systems. We analyze the architectural and cognitive foundations of general intelligence, highlighting the role of modular reasoning, persistent memory, and multi-agent coordination. In particular, we emphasize the rise of Agentic RAG frameworks that combine retrieval, planning, and dynamic tool use to enable more adaptive behavior. We discuss generalization strategies, including information compression, test-time adaptation, and training-free methods, as critical pathways toward flexible, domain-agnostic intelligence. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are reexamined not just as perception modules but as evolving interfaces for embodied understanding and collaborative task completion. We also argue that true intelligence arises not from scale alone but from the integration of memory and reasoning: an orchestration of modular, interactive, and self-improving components where compression enables adaptive behavior. Drawing on advances in neurosymbolic systems, reinforcement learning, and cognitive scaffolding, we explore how recent architectures begin to bridge the gap between statistical learning and goal-directed cognition. Finally, we identify key scientific, technical, and ethical challenges on the path to AGI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SciArena: An Open Evaluation Platform for Foundation Models in   Scientific Literature Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01001</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.01001.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yilun Zhao, Kaiyan Zhang, Tiansheng Hu, Sihong Wu, Ronan Le Bras, Taira Anderson, Jonathan Bragg, Joseph Chee Chang, Jesse Dodge, Matt Latzke, Yixin Liu, Charles McGrady, Xiangru Tang, Zihang Wang, Chen Zhao, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Doug Downey, Arman Cohan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 32&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; We present SciArena, an open and collaborative platform for evaluating foundation models on scientific literature tasks. Unlike traditional benchmarks for scientific literature understanding and synthesis, SciArena engages the research community directly, following the Chatbot Arena evaluation approach of community voting on model comparisons. By leveraging collective intelligence, SciArena offers a community-driven evaluation of model performance on open-ended scientific tasks that demand literature-grounded, long-form responses. The platform currently supports 23 open-source and proprietary foundation models and has collected over 13,000 votes from trusted researchers across diverse scientific domains. We analyze the data collected so far and confirm that the submitted questions are diverse, aligned with real-world literature needs, and that participating researchers demonstrate strong self-consistency and inter-annotator agreement in their evaluations. We discuss the results and insights based on the model ranking leaderboard. To further promote research in building model-based automated evaluation systems for literature tasks, we release SciArena-Eval, a meta-evaluation benchmark based on our collected preference data. The benchmark measures the accuracy of models in judging answer quality by comparing their pairwise assessments with human votes. Our experiments highlight the benchmark's challenges and emphasize the need for more reliable automated evaluation methods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In this report, we share our key findings in the development of the reasoning-centric training framework. We first develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential through large-scale pre-training, which arguably sets the upper bound for the final performance. Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) then unlocks the full potential of the model, leading to comprehensive capability enhancement across a diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving, video understanding, content recognition, coding, grounding, GUI-based agents, and long document understanding, among others. To facilitate research in this field, we open-source GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking, which achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of comparable size. In a comprehensive evaluation across 28 public benchmarks, our model outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B on nearly all tasks and achieves comparable or even superior performance on 18 benchmarks relative to the significantly larger Qwen2.5-VL-72B. Notably, GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking also demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to closed-source models such as GPT-4o on challenging tasks including long document understanding and STEM reasoning, further underscoring its strong capabilities. Code, models and more information are released at https://github.com/THUDM/GLM-4.1V-Thinking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
