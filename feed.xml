      <title>CUDA-L1: Improving CUDA Optimization via Contrastive Reinforcement   Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14111</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.14111.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Xiaoya Li, Xiaofei Sun, Albert Wang, Jiwei Li, Chris Shum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 14&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; The exponential growth in demand for GPU computing resources, driven by the rapid advancement of Large Language Models, has created an urgent need for automated CUDA optimization strategies. While recent advances in LLMs show promise for code generation, current SOTA models (e.g. R1, o1) achieve low success rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an automated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.   CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task: trained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250 CUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the model also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures, achieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40, x14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100. Beyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable properties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns to combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers fundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious performance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that harm performance.   The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can transform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer through speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain knowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning abilities to new kernels. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated optimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU efficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MaPPO: Maximum a Posteriori Preference Optimization with Prior Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21183</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.21183.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Guangchen Lan, Sipeng Zhang, Tianle Wang, Yuwei Zhang, Daoan Zhang, Xinpeng Wei, Xiaoman Pan, Hongming Zhang, Dong-Jun Han, Christopher G. Brinton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; As the era of large language models (LLMs) on behalf of users unfolds, Preference Optimization (PO) methods have become a central approach to aligning LLMs with human preferences and improving performance. We propose Maximum a Posteriori Preference Optimization (MaPPO), a framework for learning from preferences that explicitly incorporates prior reward knowledge into the optimization objective. While existing methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants treat preference learning as a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem, MaPPO extends this paradigm by integrating prior reward estimates into a principled Maximum a Posteriori (MaP) objective. This not only generalizes DPO and its variants, but also enhances alignment by mitigating the oversimplified binary classification of responses. More importantly, MaPPO introduces no additional hyperparameter, and supports preference optimization in both offline and online settings. In addition, MaPPO can be used as a plugin with consistent improvement on DPO variants, including widely used SimPO, IPO, and CPO. Extensive empirical evaluations of different model sizes and model series on three standard benchmarks, including MT-Bench, AlpacaEval 2.0, and Arena-Hard, demonstrate consistent improvements in alignment performance without sacrificing computational efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AnimalClue: Recognizing Animals by their Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20240</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.20240.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Risa Shinoda, Nakamasa Inoue, Iro Laina, Christian Rupprecht, Hirokatsu Kataoka&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Wildlife observation plays an important role in biodiversity conservation, necessitating robust methodologies for monitoring wildlife populations and interspecies interactions. Recent advances in computer vision have significantly contributed to automating fundamental wildlife observation tasks, such as animal detection and species identification. However, accurately identifying species from indirect evidence like footprints and feces remains relatively underexplored, despite its importance in contributing to wildlife monitoring. To bridge this gap, we introduce AnimalClue, the first large-scale dataset for species identification from images of indirect evidence. Our dataset consists of 159,605 bounding boxes encompassing five categories of indirect clues: footprints, feces, eggs, bones, and feathers. It covers 968 species, 200 families, and 65 orders. Each image is annotated with species-level labels, bounding boxes or segmentation masks, and fine-grained trait information, including activity patterns and habitat preferences. Unlike existing datasets primarily focused on direct visual features (e.g., animal appearances), AnimalClue presents unique challenges for classification, detection, and instance segmentation tasks due to the need for recognizing more detailed and subtle visual features. In our experiments, we extensively evaluate representative vision models and identify key challenges in animal identification from their traces. Our dataset and code are available at https://dahlian00.github.io/AnimalCluePage/&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Evaluating Deep Learning Models for African Wildlife Image   Classification: From DenseNet to Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21364</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.21364.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Lukman Jibril Aliyu, Umar Sani Muhammad, Bilqisu Ismail, Nasiru Muhammad, Almustapha A Wakili, Seid Muhie Yimam, Shamsuddeen Hassan Muhammad, Mustapha Abdullahi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Wildlife populations in Africa face severe threats, with vertebrate numbers declining by over 65% in the past five decades. In response, image classification using deep learning has emerged as a promising tool for biodiversity monitoring and conservation. This paper presents a comparative study of deep learning models for automatically classifying African wildlife images, focusing on transfer learning with frozen feature extractors. Using a public dataset of four species: buffalo, elephant, rhinoceros, and zebra; we evaluate the performance of DenseNet-201, ResNet-152, EfficientNet-B4, and Vision Transformer ViT-H/14. DenseNet-201 achieved the best performance among convolutional networks (67% accuracy), while ViT-H/14 achieved the highest overall accuracy (99%), but with significantly higher computational cost, raising deployment concerns. Our experiments highlight the trade-offs between accuracy, resource requirements, and deployability. The best-performing CNN (DenseNet-201) was integrated into a Hugging Face Gradio Space for real-time field use, demonstrating the feasibility of deploying lightweight models in conservation settings. This work contributes to African-grounded AI research by offering practical insights into model selection, dataset preparation, and responsible deployment of deep learning tools for wildlife conservation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MoHoBench: Assessing Honesty of Multimodal Large Language Models via   Unanswerable Visual Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21503</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.21503.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yanxu Zhu, Shitong Duan, Xiangxu Zhang, Jitao Sang, Peng Zhang, Tun Lu, Xiao Zhou, Jing Yao, Xiaoyuan Yi, Xing Xie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Recently Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved considerable advancements in vision-language tasks, yet produce potentially harmful or untrustworthy content. Despite substantial work investigating the trustworthiness of language models, MMLMs' capability to act honestly, especially when faced with visually unanswerable questions, remains largely underexplored. This work presents the first systematic assessment of honesty behaviors across various MLLMs. We ground honesty in models' response behaviors to unanswerable visual questions, define four representative types of such questions, and construct MoHoBench, a large-scale MMLM honest benchmark, consisting of 12k+ visual question samples, whose quality is guaranteed by multi-stage filtering and human verification. Using MoHoBench, we benchmarked the honesty of 28 popular MMLMs and conducted a comprehensive analysis. Our findings show that: (1) most models fail to appropriately refuse to answer when necessary, and (2) MMLMs' honesty is not solely a language modeling issue, but is deeply influenced by visual information, necessitating the development of dedicated methods for multimodal honesty alignment. Therefore, we implemented initial alignment methods using supervised and preference learning to improve honesty behavior, providing a foundation for future work on trustworthy MLLMs. Our data and code can be found at https://github.com/DSTTSD/MoHoBench.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>HunyuanWorld 1.0: Generating Immersive, Explorable, and Interactive 3D   Worlds from Words or Pixels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21809</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.21809.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; HunyuanWorld Team, Zhenwei Wang, Yuhao Liu, Junta Wu, Zixiao Gu, Haoyuan Wang, Xuhui Zuo, Tianyu Huang, Wenhuan Li, Sheng Zhang, Yihang Lian, Yulin Tsai, Lifu Wang, Sicong Liu, Puhua Jiang, Xianghui Yang, Dongyuan Guo, Yixuan Tang, Xinyue Mao, Jiaao Yu, Junlin Yu, Jihong Zhang, Meng Chen, Liang Dong, Yiwen Jia, Chao Zhang, Yonghao Tan, Hao Zhang, Zheng Ye, Peng He, Runzhou Wu, Minghui Chen, Zhan Li, Wangchen Qin, Lei Wang, Yifu Sun, Lin Niu, Xiang Yuan, Xiaofeng Yang, Yingping He, Jie Xiao, Yangyu Tao, Jianchen Zhu, Jinbao Xue, Kai Liu, Chongqing Zhao, Xinming Wu, Tian Liu, Peng Chen, Di Wang, Yuhong Liu, Linus, Jie Jiang, Tengfei Wang, Chunchao Guo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 62&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Creating immersive and playable 3D worlds from texts or images remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Existing world generation approaches typically fall into two categories: video-based methods that offer rich diversity but lack 3D consistency and rendering efficiency, and 3D-based methods that provide geometric consistency but struggle with limited training data and memory-inefficient representations. To address these limitations, we present HunyuanWorld 1.0, a novel framework that combines the best of both worlds for generating immersive, explorable, and interactive 3D scenes from text and image conditions. Our approach features three key advantages: 1) 360{\deg} immersive experiences via panoramic world proxies; 2) mesh export capabilities for seamless compatibility with existing computer graphics pipelines; 3) disentangled object representations for augmented interactivity. The core of our framework is a semantically layered 3D mesh representation that leverages panoramic images as 360{\deg} world proxies for semantic-aware world decomposition and reconstruction, enabling the generation of diverse 3D worlds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating coherent, explorable, and interactive 3D worlds while enabling versatile applications in virtual reality, physical simulation, game development, and interactive content creation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ChemDFM-R: An Chemical Reasoner LLM Enhanced with Atomized Chemical   Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21990</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.21990.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Zihan Zhao, Bo Chen, Ziping Wan, Lu Chen, Xuanze Lin, Shiyang Yu, Situo Zhang, Da Ma, Zichen Zhu, Danyang Zhang, Huayang Wang, Zhongyang Dai, Liyang Wen, Xin Chen, Kai Yu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 21&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; While large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive progress, their application in scientific domains such as chemistry remains hindered by shallow domain understanding and limited reasoning capabilities. In this work, we focus on the specific field of chemistry and develop a Chemical Reasoner LLM, ChemDFM-R. We first construct a comprehensive dataset of atomized knowledge points to enhance the model's understanding of the fundamental principles and logical structure of chemistry. Then, we propose a mix-sourced distillation strategy that integrates expert-curated knowledge with general-domain reasoning skills, followed by domain-specific reinforcement learning to enhance chemical reasoning. Experiments on diverse chemical benchmarks demonstrate that ChemDFM-R achieves state-of-the-art performance while providing interpretable, rationale-driven outputs. Further case studies illustrate how explicit reasoning chains significantly improve the reliability, transparency, and practical utility of the model in real-world human-AI collaboration scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>X-Omni: Reinforcement Learning Makes Discrete Autoregressive Image   Generative Models Great Again</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22058</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.22058.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Zigang Geng, Yibing Wang, Yeyao Ma, Chen Li, Yongming Rao, Shuyang Gu, Zhao Zhong, Qinglin Lu, Han Hu, Xiaosong Zhang, Linus, Di Wang, Jie Jiang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 23&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Numerous efforts have been made to extend the ``next token prediction'' paradigm to visual contents, aiming to create a unified approach for both image generation and understanding. Nevertheless, attempts to generate images through autoregressive modeling with discrete tokens have been plagued by issues such as low visual fidelity, distorted outputs, and failure to adhere to complex instructions when rendering intricate details. These shortcomings are likely attributed to cumulative errors during autoregressive inference or information loss incurred during the discretization process. Probably due to this challenge, recent research has increasingly shifted toward jointly training image generation with diffusion objectives and language generation with autoregressive objectives, moving away from unified modeling approaches. In this work, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning can effectively mitigate artifacts and largely enhance the generation quality of a discrete autoregressive modeling method, thereby enabling seamless integration of image and language generation. Our framework comprises a semantic image tokenizer, a unified autoregressive model for both language and images, and an offline diffusion decoder for image generation, termed X-Omni. X-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance in image generation tasks using a 7B language model, producing images with high aesthetic quality while exhibiting strong capabilities in following instructions and rendering long texts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MOVE: Motion-Guided Few-Shot Video Object Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22061</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.22061.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Kaining Ying, Hengrui Hu, Henghui Ding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; This work addresses motion-guided few-shot video object segmentation (FSVOS), which aims to segment dynamic objects in videos based on a few annotated examples with the same motion patterns. Existing FSVOS datasets and methods typically focus on object categories, which are static attributes that ignore the rich temporal dynamics in videos, limiting their application in scenarios requiring motion understanding. To fill this gap, we introduce MOVE, a large-scale dataset specifically designed for motion-guided FSVOS. Based on MOVE, we comprehensively evaluate 6 state-of-the-art methods from 3 different related tasks across 2 experimental settings. Our results reveal that current methods struggle to address motion-guided FSVOS, prompting us to analyze the associated challenges and propose a baseline method, Decoupled Motion Appearance Network (DMA). Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in few shot motion understanding, establishing a solid foundation for future research in this direction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
