      <title>On Code-Induced Reasoning in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21499</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2509.21499.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Abdul Waheed, Zhen Wu, Carolyn Ros√©, Daphne Ippolito&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Code data has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but it remains unclear which aspects of code are most responsible. We investigate this question with a systematic, data-centric framework. We construct parallel instruction datasets in ten programming languages and apply controlled perturbations that selectively disrupt structural or semantic properties of code. We then finetune LLMs from five model families and eight scales on each variant and evaluate their performance on natural language, math, and code tasks. Across 3,331 experiments, our results show that LLMs are more vulnerable to structural perturbations than semantic ones, particularly on math and code tasks. Appropriate abstractions like pseudocode and flowcharts can be as effective as code, while encoding the same information with fewer tokens without adhering to original syntax can often retain or even improve performance. Remarkably, even corrupted code with misleading signals remains competitive when surface-level regularities persist. Finally, syntactic styles also shape task-specific gains with Python favoring natural language reasoning and lower-level languages such as Java and Rust favoring math. Through our systematic framework, we aim to provide insight into how different properties of code influence reasoning and inform the design of training data for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>DRIFT: Learning from Abundant User Dissatisfaction in Real-World   Preference Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02341</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.02341.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yifan Wang, Bolian Li, Junlin Wu, Zhaoxuan Tan, Zheli Liu, Ruqi Zhang, Ananth Grama, Qingkai Zeng&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Real-world large language model deployments (e.g., conversational AI systems, code generation assistants) naturally generate abundant implicit user dissatisfaction (DSAT) signals, as users iterate toward better answers through refinements, corrections, and expressed preferences, while explicit satisfaction (SAT) feedback is scarce. Existing preference learning approaches are poorly aligned with this data profile, as they rely on costly human annotations or assume plentiful positive responses. In this paper, we introduce DRIFT (Dissatisfaction-Refined Iterative preFerence Training), which anchors training on real-world DSAT signals and samples positives dynamically from the evolving policy. Empirically, DRIFT models trained on real-world WildFeedback datasets and synthetic UltraFeedback datasets achieve up to +6.23\% (7B) / +7.61\% (14B) on WildBench Task Score and up to +8.95\% (7B) / +12.29\% (14B) on AlpacaEval2 win rate over base models, outperforming strong baseline methods such as iterative DPO and SPIN. At larger scales, the improvements are particularly pronounced: 14B models trained with DRIFT surpass GPT-4o-mini on WildBench. Further analysis shows that DRIFT also preserves exploratory capacity, yielding more diverse high-reward solutions rather than collapsing to narrow subsets. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this design preserves preference margins and avoids the gradient degeneration. These results show that DRIFT is an effective and scalable recipe for real-world post-training that leverages the most abundant and informative signal.

      <title>CoDA: Coding LM via Diffusion Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03270</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.03270.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Haolin Chen, Shiyu Wang, Can Qin, Bo Pang, Zuxin Liu, Jielin Qiu, Jianguo Zhang, Yingbo Zhou, Zeyuan Chen, Ran Xu, Shelby Heinecke, Silvio Savarese, Caiming Xiong, Huan Wang, Weiran Yao&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 25&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Diffusion language models promise bidirectional context and infilling capabilities that autoregressive coders lack, yet practical systems remain heavyweight. We introduce CoDA, a 1.7B-parameter diffusion coder trained on TPU with a fully open-source training pipeline. CoDA pairs large-scale diffusion pre-training with code-centric mid-training and instruction tuning, enabling confidence-guided sampling that keeps inference latency competitive. On Humaneval, MBPP, and EvalPlus, CoDA-1.7B-Instruct matches or surpasses diffusion models up to 7B parameters. Our release includes model checkpoints, evaluation harnesses, and TPU training pipelines to accelerate research on lightweight diffusion-based coding assistants.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>CCD: Mitigating Hallucinations in Radiology MLLMs via Clinical   Contrastive Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23379</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2509.23379.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Xi Zhang, Zaiqiao Meng, Jake Lever, Edmond S. L. Ho&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress in radiology by integrating visual perception with natural language understanding. However, they often generate clinically unsupported descriptions, known as medical hallucinations, which pose serious risks in medical applications that demand accuracy and image-grounded outputs. Through empirical analysis, we find that prompt-induced hallucinations remain prevalent in radiology MLLMs, largely due to over-sensitivity to clinical sections. To address this, we introduce Clinical Contrastive Cecoding (CCD), a training-free and retrieval-free inference framework that integrates structured clinical signals from task-specific radiology expert models. CCD introduces a dual-stage contrastive mechanism to refine token-level logits during generation, thereby enhancing clinical fidelity without modifying the base MLLM. Experiments on three datasets and multiple models demonstrate that CCD consistently improves overall performance on radiology report generation (RRG). On the MIMIC-CXR dataset, it yields up to a 17% improvement in RadGraph-F1 when applied to state-of-the-art RRG models. Our approach provides a lightweight and generalisable solution for mitigating medical hallucinations, effectively bridging expert models and MLLMs in radiology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fathom-DeepResearch: Unlocking Long Horizon Information Retrieval and   Synthesis for SLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24107</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2509.24107.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Shreyas Singh, Kunal Singh, Pradeep Moturi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 57&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Tool-integrated reasoning has emerged as a key focus for enabling agentic applications. Among these, DeepResearch Agents have gained significant attention for their strong performance on complex, open-ended information-seeking tasks. We introduce Fathom-DeepResearch, an agentic system composed of two specialized models. The first is Fathom-Search-4B, a DeepSearch model trained from Qwen3-4B and optimized for evidence-based investigation through live web search and targeted webpage querying. Its training combines three advances: (i) DUETQA, a 5K-sample dataset generated via multi-agent self-play that enforces strict web-search dependence and heterogeneous source grounding; (ii) RAPO, a zero-overhead extension of GRPO that stabilizes multi-turn Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards through curriculum pruning, reward-aware advantage scaling, and per-prompt replay buffers; and (iii) a steerable step-level reward that classifies each tool call by cognitive behavior and marginal utility, enabling explicit control over search trajectory breadth, depth, and horizon. These improvements enable reliable extension of tool-calling beyond 20 calls when warranted. The second is Fathom-Synthesizer-4B, trained from Qwen3-4B, which converts multi-turn DeepSearch traces into structured, citation-dense DeepResearch Reports for comprehensive synthesis. Evaluated on DeepSearch benchmarks (SimpleQA, FRAMES, WebWalker, Seal0, MuSiQue) and DeepResearch-Bench, the system achieves state-of-the-art performance in the open-weights category while demonstrating strong generalization to diverse reasoning tasks including HLE, AIME-25, GPQA-Diamond, and MedQA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>CARE: Cognitive-reasoning Augmented Reinforcement for Emotional Support   Conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05122</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.05122.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Jie Zhu, Yuanchen Zhou, Shuo Jiang, Junhui Li, Lifan Guo, Feng Chen, Chi Zhang, Fang Kong&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) plays a vital role in alleviating psychological stress and providing emotional value through dialogue. While recent studies have largely focused on data augmentation and synthetic corpus construction, they often overlook the deeper cognitive reasoning processes that underpin effective emotional support. To address this gap, we propose CARE, a novel framework that strengthens reasoning in ESC without relying on large-scale synthetic data. CARE leverages the original ESC training set to guide models in generating logically coherent and supportive responses, thereby explicitly enhancing cognitive reasoning. Building on this foundation, we further employ reinforcement learning to refine and reinforce the reasoning process. Experimental results demonstrate that CARE significantly improves both the logical soundness and supportive quality of responses, advancing the development of empathetic, cognitively robust, and human-like emotional support systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fast-dLLM v2: Efficient Block-Diffusion LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26328</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2509.26328.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Chengyue Wu, Hao Zhang, Shuchen Xue, Shizhe Diao, Yonggan Fu, Zhijian Liu, Pavlo Molchanov, Ping Luo, Song Han, Enze Xie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 33&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Autoregressive (AR) large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language tasks, yet their inherent sequential decoding limits inference efficiency. In this work, we propose Fast-dLLM v2, a carefully designed block diffusion language model (dLLM) that efficiently adapts pretrained AR models into dLLMs for parallel text generation, requiring only approximately 1B tokens of fine-tuning. This represents a 500x reduction in training data compared to full-attention diffusion LLMs such as Dream (580B tokens), while preserving the original model's performance. Our approach introduces a novel training recipe that combines a block diffusion mechanism with a complementary attention mask, enabling blockwise bidirectional context modeling without sacrificing AR training objectives. To further accelerate decoding, we design a hierarchical caching mechanism: a block-level cache that stores historical context representations across blocks, and a sub-block cache that enables efficient parallel generation within partially decoded blocks. Coupled with our parallel decoding pipeline, Fast-dLLM v2 achieves up to 2.5x speedup over standard AR decoding without compromising generation quality. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-dLLM v2 matches or surpasses AR baselines in accuracy, while delivering state-of-the-art efficiency among dLLMs - marking a significant step toward the practical deployment of fast and accurate LLMs. Code and model will be publicly released.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Demystifying deep search: a holistic evaluation with hint-free multi-hop   questions and factorised metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05137</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.05137.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Maojia Song, Renhang Liu, Xinyu Wang, Yong Jiang, Pengjun Xie, Fei Huang, Soujanya Poria, Jingren Zhou&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems and web agents are increasingly evaluated on multi-hop deep search tasks, yet current practice suffers from two major limitations. First, most benchmarks leak the reasoning path in the question text, allowing models to follow surface cues rather than discover reasoning chains autonomously. Second, evaluation is typically reduced to a single pass rate, which collapses diverse behaviours into one score and obscures whether failures stem from inadequate search, poor knowledge use, or inappropriate refusal. To address these issues, we present WebDetective, a benchmark of hint-free multi-hop questions paired with a controlled Wikipedia sandbox that ensures full traceability of model actions, and a holistic evaluation framework that separates search sufficiency, knowledge utilisation, and refusal behaviour. Our evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art models reveals systematic weaknesses across all architectures: models struggle with knowledge utilisation despite having sufficient evidence and demonstrate near-absent appropriate refusal when evidence is lacking. These patterns expose a fundamental gap: today's systems excel at executing given reasoning paths but fail when required to discover them. We develop an agentic workflow, EvidenceLoop, that explicitly targets the challenges our benchmark identifies, incorporating verification loops and systematic evidence tracking that improve both search and synthesis capabilities. This baseline demonstrates that WebDetective's diagnostic framework can guide concrete architectural improvements, establishing our benchmark as a critical tool for developing genuinely autonomous reasoning systems rather than pattern-following agents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>HalluGuard: Evidence-Grounded Small Reasoning Models to Mitigate   Hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00880</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.00880.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Loris Bergeron, Ioana Buhnila, J√©r√¥me Fran√ßois, Radu State&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in many NLP tasks but remain prone to hallucinations, limiting trust in real-world applications. We present HalluGuard, a 4B-parameter Small Reasoning Model (SRM) for mitigating hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). HalluGuard classifies document-claim pairs as grounded or hallucinated and produces evidence-grounded justifications for transparency. Our approach combines (i) a domain-agnostic synthetic dataset derived from FineWeb and refined through multi-stage curation and data reformation, (ii) synthetic grounded and hallucinated claims, and (iii) preference-based fine-tuning with Odds Ratio Preference Optimization to distill large-model reasoning into a smaller backbone. On the RAGTruth subset of the LLM-AggreFact benchmark, HalluGuard achieves 84.0% balanced accuracy (BAcc), rivaling specialized models, MiniCheck (7B; 84.0%) and Granite Guardian 3.3 (8B; 82.2%) while using roughly half their parameters. Over the full benchmark it reaches 75.7% BAcc, matching larger general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4o (75.9%). We will release HalluGuard and datasets under Apache 2.0 upon acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MEMTRACK: Evaluating Long-Term Memory and State Tracking in   Multi-Platform Dynamic Agent Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01353</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.01353.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Darshan Deshpande, Varun Gangal, Hersh Mehta, Anand Kannappan, Rebecca Qian, Peng Wang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Recent works on context and memory benchmarking have primarily focused on conversational instances but the need for evaluating memory in dynamic enterprise environments is crucial for its effective application. We introduce MEMTRACK, a benchmark designed to evaluate long-term memory and state tracking in multi-platform agent environments. MEMTRACK models realistic organizational workflows by integrating asynchronous events across multiple communication and productivity platforms such as Slack, Linear and Git. Each benchmark instance provides a chronologically platform-interleaved timeline, with noisy, conflicting, cross-referring information as well as potential codebase/file-system comprehension and exploration. Consequently, our benchmark tests memory capabilities such as acquistion, selection and conflict resolution. We curate the MEMTRACK dataset through both manual expert driven design and scalable agent based synthesis, generating ecologically valid scenarios grounded in real world software development processes. We introduce pertinent metrics for Correctness, Efficiency, and Redundancy that capture the effectiveness of memory mechanisms beyond simple QA performance. Experiments across SoTA LLMs and memory backends reveal challenges in utilizing memory across long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving contradictions. Notably, the best performing GPT-5 model only achieves a 60\% Correctness score on MEMTRACK. This work provides an extensible framework for advancing evaluation research for memory-augmented agents, beyond existing focus on conversational setups, and sets the stage for multi-agent, multi-platform memory benchmarking in complex organizational settings&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Matching: Generative Modeling with Implicit Energy-Based   Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02300</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.02300.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Runqian Wang, Yilun Du&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce Equilibrium Matching (EqM), a generative modeling framework built from an equilibrium dynamics perspective. EqM discards the non-equilibrium, time-conditional dynamics in traditional diffusion and flow-based generative models and instead learns the equilibrium gradient of an implicit energy landscape. Through this approach, we can adopt an optimization-based sampling process at inference time, where samples are obtained by gradient descent on the learned landscape with adjustable step sizes, adaptive optimizers, and adaptive compute. EqM surpasses the generation performance of diffusion/flow models empirically, achieving an FID of 1.90 on ImageNet 256times256. EqM is also theoretically justified to learn and sample from the data manifold. Beyond generation, EqM is a flexible framework that naturally handles tasks including partially noised image denoising, OOD detection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities with a unified equilibrium landscape, EqM offers a tighter bridge between flow and energy-based models and a simple route to optimization-driven inference.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>VeriGuard: Enhancing LLM Agent Safety via Verified Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05156</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.05156.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Lesly Miculicich, Mihir Parmar, Hamid Palangi, Krishnamurthy Dj Dvijotham, Mirko Montanari, Tomas Pfister, Long T. Le&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; The deployment of autonomous AI agents in sensitive domains, such as healthcare, introduces critical risks to safety, security, and privacy. These agents may deviate from user objectives, violate data handling policies, or be compromised by adversarial attacks. Mitigating these dangers necessitates a mechanism to formally guarantee that an agent's actions adhere to predefined safety constraints, a challenge that existing systems do not fully address. We introduce VeriGuard, a novel framework that provides formal safety guarantees for LLM-based agents through a dual-stage architecture designed for robust and verifiable correctness. The initial offline stage involves a comprehensive validation process. It begins by clarifying user intent to establish precise safety specifications. VeriGuard then synthesizes a behavioral policy and subjects it to both testing and formal verification to prove its compliance with these specifications. This iterative process refines the policy until it is deemed correct. Subsequently, the second stage provides online action monitoring, where VeriGuard operates as a runtime monitor to validate each proposed agent action against the pre-verified policy before execution. This separation of the exhaustive offline validation from the lightweight online monitoring allows formal guarantees to be practically applied, providing a robust safeguard that substantially improves the trustworthiness of LLM agents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>OneFlow: Concurrent Mixed-Modal and Interleaved Generation with Edit   Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03506</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.03506.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; John Nguyen, Marton Havasi, Tariq Berrada, Luke Zettlemoyer, Ricky T. Q. Chen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; We present OneFlow, the first non-autoregressive multimodal model that enables variable-length and concurrent mixed-modal generation. Unlike autoregressive models that enforce rigid causal ordering between text and image generation, OneFlow combines an insertion-based Edit Flow for discrete text tokens with Flow Matching for image latents. OneFlow enables concurrent text-image synthesis with hierarchical sampling that prioritizes content over grammar. Through controlled experiments across model sizes from 1B to 8B, we demonstrate that OneFlow outperforms autoregressive baselines on both generation and understanding tasks while using up to 50% fewer training FLOPs. OneFlow surpasses both autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches while unlocking new capabilities for concurrent generation, iterative refinement, and natural reasoning-like generation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.03978.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Min Woo Sun, Alejandro Lozano, Javier Gamazo Tejero, Vishwesh Nath, Xiao Xiao Sun, James Burgess, Yuhui Zhang, Kun Yuan, Robert Tibshirani, Sean Huver, Serena Yeung-Levy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Embedding vision-language models (VLMs) are typically pretrained with short text windows (&lt;77 tokens), which forces the truncation of long-format captions. Yet, the distribution of biomedical captions from large-scale open source literature reveals that a huge portion of captions far exceed 77 tokens. To this end, we investigate the impact of pretraining on long-format biomedical captions by extending the context length of text encoders in VLMs. We find that longer context (thus, enabling additional supervision provided in long-format captions) correlates with better retrieval and classification performance. Given this finding, we introduce BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, a dataset of 1M image-caption pairs enriched with context-aware descriptions from full-text articles, providing longer and additional textual supervision. Using BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, we train BMC-LongCLIP, a long-context biomedical VLM with a text encoder supporting windows of up to 512 tokens. Our model extends context capacity by 6.6x, reducing token waste from 55% to just 2.2%. On long-caption retrieval benchmarks, BMC-LongCLIP achieves up to +30% absolute gains in Recall@1 and +2% average improvements in classification, while also converging faster than short-context. Our results demonstrate that long-context modeling is a promising direction for advancing biomedical VLMs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Scaling Code-Assisted Chain-of-Thoughts and Instructions for Model   Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04081</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.04081.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Honglin Lin, Qizhi Pei, Xin Gao, Zhuoshi Pan, Yu Li, Juntao Li, Conghui He, Lijun Wu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 18&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Reasoning capability is pivotal for Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks, yet achieving reliable and scalable reasoning remains challenging. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become a mainstream approach, existing methods often suffer from uncontrolled generation, insufficient quality, and limited diversity in reasoning paths. Recent efforts leverage code to enhance CoT by grounding reasoning in executable steps, but such methods are typically constrained to predefined mathematical problems, hindering scalability and generalizability. In this work, we propose Caco (Code-Assisted Chain-of-ThOught), a novel framework that automates the synthesis of high-quality, verifiable, and diverse instruction-CoT reasoning data through code-driven augmentation. Unlike prior work, Caco first fine-tunes a code-based CoT generator on existing math and programming solutions in a unified code format, then scales the data generation to a large amount of diverse reasoning traces. Crucially, we introduce automated validation via code execution and rule-based filtering to ensure logical correctness and structural diversity, followed by reverse-engineering filtered outputs into natural language instructions and language CoTs to enrich task adaptability. This closed-loop process enables fully automated, scalable synthesis of reasoning data with guaranteed executability. Experiments on our created Caco-1.3M dataset demonstrate that Caco-trained models achieve strong competitive performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, outperforming existing strong baselines. Further analysis reveals that Caco's code-anchored verification and instruction diversity contribute to superior generalization across unseen tasks. Our work establishes a paradigm for building self-sustaining, trustworthy reasoning systems without human intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Contextual Quality Reward Model for Reliable and Efficient Best-of-N   Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04087</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.04087.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Hyung Gyu Rho&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Modern preference alignment techniques, such as Best-of-N (BoN) sampling, rely on reward models trained with pairwise comparison data. While effective at learning relative preferences, this paradigm fails to capture a signal of response acceptability, leaving systems vulnerable to selecting the least bad of many unacceptable options. This is particularly problematic for hard prompts, where the risk of such false acceptances increases with the number of samples. In this paper, we address this critical reliability gap by introducing a new data collection and modeling framework. By augmenting preference data with an outside option, inspired by discrete choice models, we train a reward model that can distinguish not just what is better, but what is good enough. We leverage this capability to create an adaptive inference strategy, best of mini-N in-loop, which partitions the generation budget into sequential loops with a calibrated, early-exit condition. Our experiments show that when tuned as an alignment guardrail, it reduces reliability failures by 70\%, and when tuned as an inference accelerator, it improves average inference speed by over 22\% in IMDB-sentiment setting. We thus provide a principled and flexible framework for practitioners to explicitly manage the trade-off between reliability and computational efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Drax: Speech Recognition with Discrete Flow Matching</title>

We propose Drax, a discrete flow matching framework for ASR that enables efficient parallel decoding. To better align training with inference, we construct an audio-conditioned probability path that guides the model through trajectories resembling likely intermediate inference errors, rather than direct random noise to target transitions. Our theoretical analysis links the generalization gap to divergences between training and inference occupancies, controlled by cumulative velocity errors, thereby motivating our design choice. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that our approach attains recognition accuracy on par with state-of-the-art speech models while offering improved accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, highlighting discrete flow matching as a promising direction for advancing NAR ASR.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>GRACE: Generative Representation Learning via Contrastive Policy   Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04506</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.04506.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Jiashuo Sun, Shixuan Liu, Zhaochen Su, Xianrui Zhong, Pengcheng Jiang, Bowen Jin, Peiran Li, Weijia Shi, Jiawei Han&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Prevailing methods for training Large Language Models (LLMs) as text encoders rely on contrastive losses that treat the model as a black box function, discarding its generative and reasoning capabilities in favor of static embeddings. We introduce GRACE (Generative Representation Learning via Contrastive Policy Optimization), a novel framework that reimagines contrastive signals not as losses to be minimized, but as rewards that guide a generative policy. In GRACE, the LLM acts as a policy that produces explicit, human-interpretable rationales--structured natural language explanations of its semantic understanding. These rationales are then encoded into high-quality embeddings via mean pooling. Using policy gradient optimization, we train the model with a multi-component reward function that maximizes similarity between query positive pairs and minimizes similarity with negatives. This transforms the LLM from an opaque encoder into an interpretable agent whose reasoning process is transparent and inspectable. On MTEB benchmark, GRACE yields broad cross category gains: averaged over four backbones, the supervised setting improves overall score by 11.5% over base models, and the unsupervised variant adds 6.9%, while preserving general capabilities. This work treats contrastive objectives as rewards over rationales, unifying representation learning with generation to produce stronger embeddings and transparent rationales. The model, data and code are available at https://github.com/GasolSun36/GRACE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ChartAgent: A Multimodal Agent for Visually Grounded Reasoning in   Complex Chart Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04514</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.04514.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Rachneet Kaur, Nishan Srishankar, Zhen Zeng, Sumitra Ganesh, Manuela Veloso&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Recent multimodal LLMs have shown promise in chart-based visual question answering, but their performance declines sharply on unannotated charts, those requiring precise visual interpretation rather than relying on textual shortcuts. To address this, we introduce ChartAgent, a novel agentic framework that explicitly performs visual reasoning directly within the chart's spatial domain. Unlike textual chain-of-thought reasoning, ChartAgent iteratively decomposes queries into visual subtasks and actively manipulates and interacts with chart images through specialized actions such as drawing annotations, cropping regions (e.g., segmenting pie slices, isolating bars), and localizing axes, using a library of chart-specific vision tools to fulfill each subtask. This iterative reasoning process closely mirrors human cognitive strategies for chart comprehension. ChartAgent achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the ChartBench and ChartX benchmarks, surpassing prior methods by up to 16.07% absolute gain overall and 17.31% on unannotated, numerically intensive queries. Furthermore, our analyses show that ChartAgent is (a) effective across diverse chart types, (b) achieve the highest scores across varying visual and reasoning complexity levels, and (c) serves as a plug-and-play framework that boosts performance across diverse underlying LLMs. Our work is among the first to demonstrate visually grounded reasoning for chart understanding using tool-augmented multimodal agents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Less is More: Recursive Reasoning with Tiny Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04871</link>

This biologically inspired method beats Large Language models (LLMs) on hard puzzle tasks such as Sudoku, Maze, and ARC-AGI while trained with small models (27M parameters) on small data (around 1000 examples). HRM holds great promise for solving hard problems with small networks, but it is not yet well understood and may be suboptimal. We propose Tiny Recursive Model (TRM), a much simpler recursive reasoning approach that achieves significantly higher generalization than HRM, while using a single tiny network with only 2 layers. With only 7M parameters, TRM obtains 45% test-accuracy on ARC-AGI-1 and 8% on ARC-AGI-2, higher than most LLMs (e.g., Deepseek R1, o3-mini, Gemini 2.5 Pro) with less than 0.01% of the parameters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Let it Calm: Exploratory Annealed Decoding for Verifiable Reinforcement   Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05251</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.05251.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Chenghao Yang, Lin Gui, Chenxiao Yang, Victor Veitch, Lizhu Zhang, Zhuokai Zhao&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), yet its success hinges on effective exploration. An ideal exploration strategy must navigate two fundamental challenges: it must preserve sample quality while also ensuring training stability. While standard fixed-temperature sampling is simple, it struggles to balance these competing demands, as high temperatures degrade sample quality and low temperatures limit discovery. In this work, we propose a simpler and more effective strategy, Exploratory Annealed Decoding (EAD), grounded in the insight that exploration is most impactful on early tokens which define a sequence's semantic direction. EAD implements an intuitive **explore-at-the-beginning, exploit-at-the-end** strategy by annealing the sampling temperature from high to low during generation. This dynamic schedule encourages meaningful, high-level diversity at the start, then gradually lowers the temperature to preserve sample quality and keep the sampling distribution close to the target policy, which is essential for stable training. We demonstrate that EAD is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that significantly improves sample efficiency, consistently outperforming fixed-temperature sampling across various RLVR algorithms and model sizes. Our work suggests that aligning exploration with the natural dynamics of sequential generation offers a robust path to improving LLM reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>BIRD-INTERACT: Re-imagining Text-to-SQL Evaluation for Large Language   Models via Lens of Dynamic Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05318</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.05318.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Nan Huo, Xiaohan Xu, Jinyang Li, Per Jacobsson, Shipei Lin, Bowen Qin, Binyuan Hui, Xiaolong Li, Ge Qu, Shuzheng Si, Linheng Han, Edward Alexander, Xintong Zhu, Rui Qin, Ruihan Yu, Yiyao Jin, Feige Zhou, Weihao Zhong, Yun Chen, Hongyu Liu, Chenhao Ma, Fatma Ozcan, Yannis Papakonstantinou, Reynold Cheng&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on single-turn text-to-SQL tasks, but real-world database applications predominantly require multi-turn interactions to handle ambiguous queries, execution errors, and evolving user requirements. Existing multi-turn benchmarks fall short by treating conversation histories as static context or limiting evaluation to read-only operations, failing to reflect production-grade database assistant challenges. We introduce BIRD-INTERACT, a benchmark that restores this realism through: (1) a comprehensive interaction environment coupling each database with a hierarchical knowledge base, metadata files, and a function-driven user simulator, enabling models to solicit clarifications, retrieve knowledge, and recover from errors without human supervision; (2) two evaluation settings consisting of a pre-defined conversational protocol (c-Interact) and an open-ended agentic setting (a-Interact) where models autonomously decide when to query the user simulator or explore the environment; (3) a challenging task suite covering the full CRUD spectrum for business-intelligence and operational use cases, guarded by executable test cases. Each task features ambiguous and follow-up sub-tasks requiring dynamic interaction. The suite comprises BIRD-INTERACT-FULL (600 tasks, up to 11,796 interactions) for comprehensive performance assessment, and BIRD-INTERACT-LITE (300 tasks with simplified databases) for detailed behavioral analysis and rapid method development. Our empirical results highlight BIRD-INTERACT's difficulty: GPT-5 completes only 8.67% of tasks in c-Interact and 17.00% in a-Interact. Analysis via memory grafting and Interaction Test-time Scaling validates the importance of effective interaction for complex, dynamic text-to-SQL tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Margin Adaptive DPO: Leveraging Reward Model for Granular Control in   Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05342</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.05342.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Hyung Gyu Rho&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective method for aligning large language models. However, its reliance on a fixed temperature parameter leads to suboptimal training on diverse preference data, causing overfitting on easy examples and under-learning from informative ones. Recent methods have emerged to counter this. While IPO addresses general overfitting, its uniform regularization can be overly conservative. The more targeted approach of beta-DPO suffers from its own limitations: its batch-level adaptation applies a single, compromised temperature to mixed-margin pairs, its linear update rule can produce unstable negative beta values, and its filtering mechanism discards potentially useful training signals. In this work, we introduce Margin-Adaptive Direct Preference Optimization (MADPO), a method that provides a stable, data-preserving, and instance-level solution. MADPO employs a practical two-step approach: it first trains a reward model to estimate preference margins and then uses these margins to apply a continuous, adaptive weight to the DPO loss for each individual training sample. This re-weighting scheme creates an effective target margin that is amplified for hard pairs and dampened for easy pairs, allowing for granular control over the learning signal. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, proving that MADPO has a well-behaved optimization landscape and is robust to reward model estimation errors. We validate our theory with experiments on a sentiment generation task, where MADPO consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines across datasets of varying quality. It achieves performance gains of up to +33.3\% on High Quality data and +10.5\% on Low Quality data over the next-best method. Our results establish MADPO as a more robust and principled approach to preference alignment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LightCache: Memory-Efficient, Training-Free Acceleration for Video   Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05367</link>

The redundancy of latents in diffusion model inference provides a natural entry point for acceleration. In this paper, we decompose the inference process into the encoding, denoising, and decoding stages, and observe that cache-based acceleration methods often lead to substantial memory surges in the latter two stages. To address this problem, we analyze the characteristics of inference across different stages and propose stage-specific strategies for reducing memory consumption: 1) Asynchronous Cache Swapping. 2) Feature chunk. 3) Slicing latents to decode. At the same time, we ensure that the time overhead introduced by these three strategies remains lower than the acceleration gains themselves. Compared with the baseline, our approach achieves faster inference speed and lower memory usage, while maintaining quality degradation within an acceptable range. The Code is available at https://github.com/NKUShaw/LightCache .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Scalable In-context Ranking with Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05396</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.05396.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Nilesh Gupta, Chong You, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Sanjiv Kumar, Inderjit Dhillon, Felix Yu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; In-context Ranking (ICR) is an emerging paradigm for Information Retrieval (IR), which leverages contextual understanding of LLMs by directly incorporating the task description, candidate documents, and the query into the model's input prompt and tasking the LLM to identify relevant document(s). While it is effective, efficiency is a significant challenge in this paradigm, especially as the candidate list grows due to quadratic/super-linear scaling of attention operation with context length. To this end, this paper first identifies inherent and exploitable structures in the attention of LLMs finetuned for ICR: (1) inter-document block sparsity: attention is dense within each document block but sparse across different documents in the context; and (2) query-document block relevance: the attention scores from certain query tokens to a document block in middle layers strongly correlate with that document's actual relevance. Motivated by these observations, we introduce BlockRank (Blockwise In-context Ranking), a novel method that adapts the attention operation in an LLM by (a) architecturally enforcing the observed inter-document block sparsity, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear without loss in performance, and (b) optimizing query-document block relevance for true relevant documents during fine-tuning using an auxiliary contrastive training objective, improving retrieval in attention. Experiments on BEIR, MSMarco and NQ with Mistral-7B demonstrate that FLARE Mistral matches or outperforms existing SOTA listwise rankers and controlled fine-tuned baseline while being significantly more efficient at inference (4.7x for 100 MSMarco documents in context) and scaling gracefully to long-context shortlists, around 500 documents in-context (approximately 100K context length) within a second, presenting a scalable and effective solution for ICR.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AInstein: Assessing the Feasibility of AI-Generated Approaches to   Research Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05432</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.05432.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Shambhavi Mishra, Gaurav Sahu, Marco Pedersoli, Laurent Charlin, Jose Dolz, Christopher Pal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects genuine reasoning or sophisticated recall. We introduce AInstein, a framework for testing whether LLMs can generate valid solutions to AI research problems using only their pretrained parametric knowledge -- without domain-specific fine-tuning, retrieval augmentation, or other external aids. Our approach extracts distilled problem statements from high-quality ICLR 2025 submissions, then tasks specialized solver agents with proposing and refining technical solutions through iterative critique loops, mimicking the cycles of proposal, review, and revision central to scientific inquiry. We evaluate AInstein on 1,214 ICLR papers stratified by acceptance tier (Oral, Spotlight, Poster), using an LLM-as-a-judge paradigm guided by a structured rubric, complemented by targeted manual checks. Performance is assessed with three metrics: Success Rate (does the solution address the problem?), Rediscovery (does it align with human-proposed methods?), and Novelty (does it yield valid, original approaches?). Our results reveal that while LLMs can rediscover feasible solutions and occasionally propose creative alternatives, their problem-solving ability remains fragile and highly sensitive to framing. These findings provide the first large-scale evidence on the extent to which LLMs can act as autonomous scientific problem-solvers, highlighting both their latent potential and their current limitations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>TensorBLEU: Vectorized GPU-based BLEU Score Implementation for   Per-Sentence In-Training Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05485</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.05485.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Adam Filipek&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Modern natural language processing models have achieved unprecedented scale, yet the tools for their evaluation often remain a computational bottleneck, limiting the pace of research. This is particularly acute for in-training evaluation metrics, such as per-sentence reward signals in Reinforcement Learning, which must operate efficiently on batches of token IDs directly on the GPU. In this paper, we introduce TensorBLEU, a novel implementation of the BLEU metric designed from the ground up for this specific use case. Our approach is fully vectorized for GPU-accelerated, per-sentence computation within PyTorch and introduces a memory-efficient counting mechanism. By creating a compact, batch-specific dictionary of n-grams using torch.unique, our method avoids the prohibitive memory costs of traditional hashing-based vectorization, making it practical for large-vocabulary models. We benchmark TensorBLEU against NLTK, the standard library for token-ID-based BLEU calculation on the CPU. Experiments show that TensorBLEU provides speedups of over 13x on consumer-grade GPUs (NVIDIA T4) and exceeding 40x on data-center-class hardware (NVIDIA A100). This performance transforms a significant bottleneck into a negligible part of the training loop. By clearly defining its role as a "Token-ID BLEU" for development purposes and open-sourcing our implementation, we provide a powerful tool for accelerating research in areas like RL-based model fine-tuning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>HoloScene: Simulation-Ready Interactive 3D Worlds from a Single Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05560</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.05560.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Hongchi Xia, Chih-Hao Lin, Hao-Yu Hsu, Quentin Leboutet, Katelyn Gao, Michael Paulitsch, Benjamin Ummenhofer, Shenlong Wang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Digitizing the physical world into accurate simulation-ready virtual environments offers significant opportunities in a variety of fields such as augmented and virtual reality, gaming, and robotics. However, current 3D reconstruction and scene-understanding methods commonly fall short in one or more critical aspects, such as geometry completeness, object interactivity, physical plausibility, photorealistic rendering, or realistic physical properties for reliable dynamic simulation. To address these limitations, we introduce HoloScene, a novel interactive 3D reconstruction framework that simultaneously achieves these requirements. HoloScene leverages a comprehensive interactive scene-graph representation, encoding object geometry, appearance, and physical properties alongside hierarchical and inter-object relationships. Reconstruction is formulated as an energy-based optimization problem, integrating observational data, physical constraints, and generative priors into a unified, coherent objective. Optimization is efficiently performed via a hybrid approach combining sampling-based exploration with gradient-based refinement. The resulting digital twins exhibit complete and precise geometry, physical stability, and realistic rendering from novel viewpoints. Evaluations conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance, while practical use-cases in interactive gaming and real-time digital-twin manipulation illustrate HoloScene's broad applicability and effectiveness.

      <title>Presenting a Paper is an Art: Self-Improvement Aesthetic Agents for   Academic Presentations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05571</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.05571.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Chengzhi Liu, Yuzhe Yang, Kaiwen Zhou, Zhen Zhang, Yue Fan, Yannan Xie, Peng Qi, Xin Eric Wang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; The promotion of academic papers has become an important means of enhancing research visibility. However, existing automated methods struggle limited storytelling, insufficient aesthetic quality, and constrained self-adjustment, making it difficult to achieve efficient and engaging dissemination. At the heart of those challenges is a simple principle: there is no way to improve it when you cannot evaluate it right. To address this, we introduce EvoPresent, a self-improvement agent framework that unifies coherent narratives, aesthetic-aware designs, and realistic presentation delivery via virtual characters. Central to EvoPresent is PresAesth, a multi-task reinforcement learning (RL) aesthetic model that provides reliable aesthetic scoring, defect adjustment, and comparative feedback, enabling iterative self-improvement even under limited aesthetic training data. To systematically evaluate the methods, we introduce EvoPresent Benchmark, a comprehensive benchmark comprising: Presentation Generation Quality, built on 650 top-tier AI conference papers with multimodal resources (slides, videos and scripts) to assess both content and design; and Aesthetic Awareness, consisting of 2,000 slide pairs with varying aesthetic levels, supporting joint training and evaluation on scoring, defect adjustment, and comparison. Our findings highlight that (i) High-quality feedback is essential for agent self-improvement, while initial capability alone does not guarantee effective self-correction. (ii) Automated generation pipelines exhibit a trade-off between visual design and content construction. (iii) Multi-task RL training shows stronger generalization in aesthetic awareness tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>In-the-Flow Agentic System Optimization for Effective Planning and Tool   Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05592</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.05592.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Zhuofeng Li, Haoxiang Zhang, Seungju Han, Sheng Liu, Jianwen Xie, Yu Zhang, Yejin Choi, James Zou, Pan Lu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 29&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Outcome-driven reinforcement learning has advanced reasoning in large language models (LLMs), but prevailing tool-augmented approaches train a single, monolithic policy that interleaves thoughts and tool calls under full context; this scales poorly with long horizons and diverse tools and generalizes weakly to new scenarios. Agentic systems offer a promising alternative by decomposing work across specialized modules, yet most remain training-free or rely on offline training decoupled from the live dynamics of multi-turn interaction. We introduce AgentFlow, a trainable, in-the-flow agentic framework that coordinates four modules (planner, executor, verifier, generator) through an evolving memory and directly optimizes its planner inside the multi-turn loop. To train on-policy in live environments, we propose Flow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO), which tackles long-horizon, sparse-reward credit assignment by converting multi-turn optimization into a sequence of tractable single-turn policy updates. It broadcasts a single, verifiable trajectory-level outcome to every turn to align local planner decisions with global success and stabilizes learning with group-normalized advantages. Across ten benchmarks, AgentFlow with a 7B-scale backbone outperforms top-performing baselines with average accuracy gains of 14.9% on search, 14.0% on agentic, 14.5% on mathematical, and 4.1% on scientific tasks, even surpassing larger proprietary models like GPT-4o. Further analyses confirm the benefits of in-the-flow optimization, showing improved planning, enhanced tool-calling reliability, and positive scaling with model size and reasoning turns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Verifier-free Test-Time Sampling for Vision Language Action Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05681</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.05681.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Suhyeok Jang, Dongyoung Kim, Changyeon Kim, Youngsuk Kim, Jinwoo Shin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in robot control. However, they remain fundamentally limited in tasks that require high precision due to their single-inference paradigm. While test-time scaling approaches using external verifiers have shown promise, they require additional training and fail to generalize to unseen conditions. We propose Masking Distribution Guided Selection (MG-Select), a novel test-time scaling framework for VLAs that leverages the model's internal properties without requiring additional training or external modules. Our approach utilizes KL divergence from a reference action token distribution as a confidence metric for selecting the optimal action from multiple candidates. We introduce a reference distribution generated by the same VLA but with randomly masked states and language conditions as inputs, ensuring maximum uncertainty while remaining aligned with the target task distribution. Additionally, we propose a joint training strategy that enables the model to learn both conditional and unconditional distributions by applying dropout to state and language conditions, thereby further improving the quality of the reference distribution. Our experiments demonstrate that MG-Select achieves significant performance improvements, including a 28%/35% improvement in real-world in-distribution/out-of-distribution tasks, along with a 168% relative gain on RoboCasa pick-and-place tasks trained with 30 demonstrations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Revisiting Modeling and Evaluation Approaches in Speech Emotion   Recognition: Considering Subjectivity of Annotators and Ambiguity of Emotions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05934</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.05934.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Huang-Cheng Chou, Chi-Chun Lee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Over the past two decades, speech emotion recognition (SER) has received growing attention. To train SER systems, researchers collect emotional speech databases annotated by crowdsourced or in-house raters who select emotions from predefined categories. However, disagreements among raters are common. Conventional methods treat these disagreements as noise, aggregating labels into a single consensus target. While this simplifies SER as a single-label task, it ignores the inherent subjectivity of human emotion perception. This dissertation challenges such assumptions and asks: (1) Should minority emotional ratings be discarded? (2) Should SER systems learn from only a few individuals' perceptions? (3) Should SER systems predict only one emotion per sample?   Psychological studies show that emotion perception is subjective and ambiguous, with overlapping emotional boundaries. We propose new modeling and evaluation perspectives: (1) Retain all emotional ratings and represent them with soft-label distributions. Models trained on individual annotator ratings and jointly optimized with standard SER systems improve performance on consensus-labeled tests. (2) Redefine SER evaluation by including all emotional data and allowing co-occurring emotions (e.g., sad and angry). We propose an ``all-inclusive rule'' that aggregates all ratings to maximize diversity in label representation. Experiments on four English emotion databases show superior performance over majority and plurality labeling. (3) Construct a penalization matrix to discourage unlikely emotion combinations during training. Integrating it into loss functions further improves performance. Overall, embracing minority ratings, multiple annotators, and multi-emotion predictions yields more robust and human-aligned SER systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Adaptive Pruning for Increased Robustness and Reduced Computational   Overhead in Gaussian Process Accelerated Saddle Point Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06030</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.06030.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Rohit Goswami, Hannes J√≥nsson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Gaussian process (GP) regression provides a strategy for accelerating saddle point searches on high-dimensional energy surfaces by reducing the number of times the energy and its derivatives with respect to atomic coordinates need to be evaluated. The computational overhead in the hyperparameter optimization can, however, be large and make the approach inefficient. Failures can also occur if the search ventures too far into regions that are not represented well enough by the GP model. Here, these challenges are resolved by using geometry-aware optimal transport measures and an active pruning strategy using a summation over Wasserstein-1 distances for each atom-type in farthest-point sampling, selecting a fixed-size subset of geometrically diverse configurations to avoid rapidly increasing cost of GP updates as more observations are made. Stability is enhanced by permutation-invariant metric that provides a reliable trust radius for early-stopping and a logarithmic barrier penalty for the growth of the signal variance. These physically motivated algorithmic changes prove their efficacy by reducing to less than a half the mean computational time on a set of 238 challenging configurations from a previously published data set of chemical reactions. With these improvements, the GP approach is established as, a robust and scalable algorithm for accelerating saddle point searches when the evaluation of the energy and atomic forces requires significant computational effort.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Refusal Falls off a Cliff: How Safety Alignment Fails in Reasoning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06036</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.06036.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Qingyu Yin, Chak Tou Leong, Linyi Yang, Wenxuan Huang, Wenjie Li, Xiting Wang, Jaehong Yoon, YunXing, XingYu, Jinjin Gu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Large reasoning models (LRMs) with multi-step reasoning capabilities have shown remarkable problem-solving abilities, yet they exhibit concerning safety vulnerabilities that remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate why safety alignment fails in reasoning models through a mechanistic interpretability lens. Using a linear probing approach to trace refusal intentions across token positions, we discover a striking phenomenon termed as refusal cliff: many poorly-aligned reasoning models correctly identify harmful prompts and maintain strong refusal intentions during their thinking process, but experience a sharp drop in refusal scores at the final tokens before output generation. This suggests that these models are not inherently unsafe; rather, their refusal intentions are systematically suppressed. Through causal intervention analysis, we identify a sparse set of attention heads that negatively contribute to refusal behavior. Ablating just 3\% of these heads can reduce attack success rates below 10\%. Building on these mechanistic insights, we propose Cliff-as-a-Judge, a novel data selection method that identifies training examples exhibiting the largest refusal cliff to efficiently repair reasoning models' safety alignment. This approach achieves comparable safety improvements using only 1.7\% of the vanilla safety training data, demonstrating a less-is-more effect in safety alignment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MixReasoning: Switching Modes to Think</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06052</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.06052.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Haiquan Lu, Gongfan Fang, Xinyin Ma, Qi Li, Xinchao Wang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 16&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Reasoning models enhance performance by tackling problems in a step-by-step manner, decomposing them into sub-problems and exploring long chains of thought before producing an answer. However, applying extended reasoning to every step introduces substantial redundancy, as sub-problems vary widely in difficulty and complexity: a small number of pivotal steps are genuinely challenging and decisive for the final answer, while many others only involve straightforward revisions or simple computations. Therefore, a natural idea is to endow reasoning models with the ability to adaptively respond to this variation, rather than treating all steps with the same level of elaboration. To this end, we propose MixReasoning, a framework that dynamically adjusts the depth of reasoning within a single response. The resulting chain of thought then becomes a mixture of detailed reasoning on difficult steps and concise inference on simpler ones. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME show that MixReasoning shortens reasoning length and substantially improves efficiency without compromising accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Scientific Algorithm Discovery by Augmenting AlphaEvolve with Deep   Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06056</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.06056.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Gang Liu, Yihan Zhu, Jie Chen, Meng Jiang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Large language models hold promise as scientific assistants, yet existing agents either rely solely on algorithm evolution or on deep research in isolation, both of which face critical limitations. Pure algorithm evolution, as in AlphaEvolve, depends only on the internal knowledge of LLMs and quickly plateaus in complex domains, while pure deep research proposes ideas without validation, resulting in unrealistic or unimplementable solutions. We present DeepEvolve, an agent that integrates deep research with algorithm evolution, uniting external knowledge retrieval, cross-file code editing, and systematic debugging under a feedback-driven iterative loop. Each iteration not only proposes new hypotheses but also refines, implements, and tests them, avoiding both shallow improvements and unproductive over-refinements. Across nine benchmarks in chemistry, mathematics, biology, materials, and patents, DeepEvolve consistently improves the initial algorithm, producing executable new algorithms with sustained gains. By bridging the gap between unguided evolution and research without grounding, DeepEvolve provides a reliable framework for advancing scientific algorithm discovery. Our code is available at https://github.com/liugangcode/deepevolve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ASPO: Asymmetric Importance Sampling Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06062</link>

However, we identify a fundamental flaw in this Outcome-Supervised RL (OSRL) paradigm: the Importance Sampling (IS) ratios of positive-advantage tokens are mismatched, leading to unbalanced token weighting for positive and negative tokens. This mismatch suppresses the update of low-probability tokens while over-amplifying already high-probability ones. To address this, we propose Asymmetric Importance Sampling Policy Optimization (ASPO), which uses a simple yet effective strategy that flips the IS ratios of positive-advantage tokens, aligning their update direction with the learning dynamics of negative ones. AIS further incorporates a soft dual-clipping mechanism to stabilize extreme updates while maintaining gradient flow. Comprehensive experiments on coding and mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ASPO significantly mitigates premature convergence, improves training stability, and enhances final performance over strong GRPO-based baselines. Our analysis provides new insights into the role of token-level weighting in OSRL and highlights the critical importance of correcting IS in LLM RL. The code and models of ASPO are available at https://github.com/wizard-III/Archer2.0.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Benchmark It Yourself (BIY): Preparing a Dataset and Benchmarking AI   Models for Scatterplot-Related Tasks</title>

To address this gap for one of the most common chart types, we introduce a synthetic, annotated dataset of over 18,000 scatterplots from six data generators and 17 chart designs, and a benchmark based on it. We evaluate proprietary models from OpenAI and Google using N-shot prompting on five distinct tasks derived from annotations of cluster bounding boxes, their center coordinates, and outlier coordinates. OpenAI models and Gemini 2.5 Flash, especially when prompted with examples, are viable options for counting clusters and, in Flash's case, outliers (90%+ Accuracy). However, the results for localization-related tasks are unsatisfactory: Precision and Recall are near or below 50%, except for Flash in outlier identification (65.01%). Furthermore, the impact of chart design on performance appears to be a secondary factor, but it is advisable to avoid scatterplots with wide aspect ratios (16:9 and 21:9) or those colored randomly.

      <title>The Valley of Code Reasoning: Scaling Knowledge Distillation of Large   Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06101</link>

Yet, there is a scarcity of work done on how model performances scale with the quantity of distillation data. In this work, we study the scaling trend of distilling competitive coding skills on two small non-reasoning LLMs. We validate the hypothesis that there is a valley of code reasoning: downstream performance on competitive coding first drops as data quantity increases, then it steadily increases in a sharper-than-log-linear fashion. Having identified the trend, we further fine-tune the models at two different distillation stages on the same data to ground conclusions on their respective learning phases. We learn that across stages in the low and medium-low data regimes, small models benefit significantly from easier coding questions than from harder ones. We also find that, surprisingly, the correctness of outputs in training data makes no difference to distillation outcomes. Our work represents a step forward in understanding the training dynamics of code reasoning distillation outside intuition&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Distributional Semantics Tracing: A Framework for Explaining   Hallucinations in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06107</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.06107.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Gagan Bhatia, Somayajulu G Sripada, Kevin Allan, Jacobo Azcona&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, the generation of plausible yet factually incorrect statements. This work investigates the intrinsic, architectural origins of this failure mode through three primary contributions.First, to enable the reliable tracing of internal semantic failures, we propose Distributional Semantics Tracing (DST), a unified framework that integrates established interpretability techniques to produce a causal map of a model's reasoning, treating meaning as a function of context (distributional semantics). Second, we pinpoint the model's layer at which a hallucination becomes inevitable, identifying a specific commitment layer where a model's internal representations irreversibly diverge from factuality. Third, we identify the underlying mechanism for these failures. We observe a conflict between distinct computational pathways, which we interpret using the lens of dual-process theory: a fast, heuristic associative pathway (akin to System 1) and a slow, deliberate contextual pathway (akin to System 2), leading to predictable failure modes such as Reasoning Shortcut Hijacks. Our framework's ability to quantify the coherence of the contextual pathway reveals a strong negative correlation (rho = -0.863) with hallucination rates, implying that these failures are predictable consequences of internal semantic weakness. The result is a mechanistic account of how, when, and why hallucinations occur within the Transformer architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Discrete Diffusion Models with MLLMs for Unified Medical Multimodal   Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06131</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.06131.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Jiawei Mao, Yuhan Wang, Lifeng Chen, Can Zhao, Yucheng Tang, Dong Yang, Liangqiong Qu, Daguang Xu, Yuyin Zhou&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 9&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Recent advances in generative medical models are constrained by modality-specific scenarios that hinder the integration of complementary evidence from imaging, pathology, and clinical notes. This fragmentation limits their evolution into foundation models that can learn and reason across the full spectrum of biomedical data. We propose MeDiM, the first medical discrete diffusion model that learns shared distributions across modalities without modality-specific components. MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks: translating between images and text, and jointly producing image-report pairs across domains in response to prompts. Built on a discrete diffusion framework, MeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared probabilistic space. To enable unified and flexible medical generation, we employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone, leveraging its prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning. Two key designs are introduced: (1) removing the causal attention mask for bidirectional context, and (2) injecting continuous timestep embeddings for diffusion awareness. Experiments demonstrate high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on MIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR 0.2650 and 0.2580). Jointly generated image-report pairs further enhance downstream performance (plus6.43 percent BLEU-1, plus18.57 percent BLEU-2, plus31.58 percent BLEU-3, plus4.80 percent METEOR), showing that MeDiM supports coherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Deforming Videos to Masks: Flow Matching for Referring Video   Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06139</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.06139.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Zanyi Wang, Dengyang Jiang, Liuzhuozheng Li, Sizhe Dang, Chengzu Li, Harry Yang, Guang Dai, Mengmeng Wang, Jingdong Wang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) requires segmenting specific objects in a video guided by a natural language description. The core challenge of RVOS is to anchor abstract linguistic concepts onto a specific set of pixels and continuously segment them through the complex dynamics of a video. Faced with this difficulty, prior work has often decomposed the task into a pragmatic `locate-then-segment' pipeline. However, this cascaded design creates an information bottleneck by simplifying semantics into coarse geometric prompts (e.g, point), and struggles to maintain temporal consistency as the segmenting process is often decoupled from the initial language grounding. To overcome these fundamental limitations, we propose FlowRVS, a novel framework that reconceptualizes RVOS as a conditional continuous flow problem. This allows us to harness the inherent strengths of pretrained T2V models, fine-grained pixel control, text-video semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. Instead of conventional generating from noise to mask or directly predicting mask, we reformulate the task by learning a direct, language-guided deformation from a video's holistic representation to its target mask. Our one-stage, generative approach achieves new state-of-the-art results across all major RVOS benchmarks. Specifically, achieving a J&amp;F of 51.1 in MeViS (+1.6 over prior SOTA) and 73.3 in the zero shot Ref-DAVIS17 (+2.7), demonstrating the significant potential of modeling video understanding tasks as continuous deformation processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mixing Mechanisms: How Language Models Retrieve Bound Entities   In-Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06182</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.06182.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yoav Gur-Arieh, Mor Geva, Atticus Geiger&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; A key component of in-context reasoning is the ability of language models (LMs) to bind entities for later retrieval. For example, an LM might represent "Ann loves pie" by binding "Ann" to "pie", allowing it to later retrieve "Ann" when asked "Who loves pie?" Prior research on short lists of bound entities found strong evidence that LMs implement such retrieval via a positional mechanism, where "Ann" is retrieved based on its position in context. In this work, we find that this mechanism generalizes poorly to more complex settings; as the number of bound entities in context increases, the positional mechanism becomes noisy and unreliable in middle positions. To compensate for this, we find that LMs supplement the positional mechanism with a lexical mechanism (retrieving "Ann" using its bound counterpart "pie") and a reflexive mechanism (retrieving "Ann" through a direct pointer). Through extensive experiments on nine models and ten binding tasks, we uncover a consistent pattern in how LMs mix these mechanisms to drive model behavior. We leverage these insights to develop a causal model combining all three mechanisms that estimates next token distributions with 95% agreement. Finally, we show that our model generalizes to substantially longer inputs of open-ended text interleaved with entity groups, further demonstrating the robustness of our findings in more natural settings. Overall, our study establishes a more complete picture of how LMs bind and retrieve entities in-context.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ShapeGen4D: Towards High Quality 4D Shape Generation from Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06208</link>

Yeh, Peter Wonka, Chaoyang Wang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 9&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Video-conditioned 4D shape generation aims to recover time-varying 3D geometry and view-consistent appearance directly from an input video. In this work, we introduce a native video-to-4D shape generation framework that synthesizes a single dynamic 3D representation end-to-end from the video. Our framework introduces three key components based on large-scale pre-trained 3D models: (i) a temporal attention that conditions generation on all frames while producing a time-indexed dynamic representation; (ii) a time-aware point sampling and 4D latent anchoring that promote temporally consistent geometry and texture; and (iii) noise sharing across frames to enhance temporal stability. Our method accurately captures non-rigid motion, volume changes, and even topological transitions without per-frame optimization. Across diverse in-the-wild videos, our method improves robustness and perceptual fidelity and reduces failure modes compared with the baselines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Training Dynamics Impact Post-Training Quantization Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06213</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.06213.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Albert Catalan-Tatjer, Niccol√≤ Ajroldi, Jonas Geiping&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; While post-training quantization is widely adopted for efficient deployment of large language models, the mechanisms underlying quantization robustness remain unclear. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of quantization degradation across open-source language model training trajectories up to 32B parameters and 15T training tokens to accurately assess the relationship between training dynamics and quantization performance. Our key finding is that quantization errors in large-scale training runs are driven by a complex interplay between learning rate and other training hyperparameters. Specifically, once learning rates decay, validation loss and quantization error diverge, largely independent of training data scale. To investigate interventions on the training dynamics and identify specific configurations that can modulate quantization robustness favorably, we train our own models in controlled experiments up to 100B tokens. Our results challenge the assumption that increasing dataset scale inherently compromises quantization effectiveness, demonstrating instead that strategic training hyperparameter interventions can improve quantization quality at scale.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>TaTToo: Tool-Grounded Thinking PRM for Test-Time Scaling in Tabular   Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06217</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.06217.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Jiaru Zou, Soumya Roy, Vinay Kumar Verma, Ziyi Wang, David Wipf, Pan Lu, Sumit Negi, James Zou, Jingrui He&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 55&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs), particularly in the context of test-time scaling (TTS). However, their potential for supervising LRMs on tabular reasoning domains remains underexplored. Through detailed empirical analyses, we identify that existing PRMs, though widely adopted for supervising text-only reasoning steps, struggle with table-specific operations such as sub-table retrieval and schema interaction, leading to critical performance bottlenecks. To address this limitation, we propose TaTToo, a novel table-grounded PRM framework that (i) reasons explicitly over tabular reasoning steps and (ii) integrates tool-based verification to provide precise reward supervision. Concretely, we first design a scalable data curation pipeline that constructs over 60k high-quality step-level annotations by integrating table verification rationales with tool-based executions. Building on the collected data, we train TaTToo with a dual-stage paradigm: cold-start supervised fine-tuning to capture tool-use reasoning patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with tool-grounded reward shaping to align our model with table-based verification. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of the policy improvement induced by our newly designed PRM. Across 5 challenging tabular reasoning benchmarks covering numerical reasoning, fact-checking, and data analysis, TaTToo improves downstream policy LRMs by 30.9% at inference, surpasses strong PRM baselines such as Qwen-2.5-Math-PRM-72B with only 8B parameters, and demonstrates strong generalizability across diverse TTS strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>EgoNight: Towards Egocentric Vision Understanding at Night with a   Challenging Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06218</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.06218.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Deheng Zhang, Yuqian Fu, Runyi Yang, Yang Miao, Tianwen Qian, Xu Zheng, Guolei Sun, Ajad Chhatkuli, Xuanjing Huang, Yu-Gang Jiang, Luc Van Gool, Danda Pani Paudel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Most existing benchmarks for egocentric vision understanding focus primarily on daytime scenarios, overlooking the low-light conditions that are inevitable in real-world applications. To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the first comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual question answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the introduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation quality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between lighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered by Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are visually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct EgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and refinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked by annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs across 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of human work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to night, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions. Beyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night correspondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further explore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a strong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research and for developing models that generalize across illumination domains. All the data and code will be made available upon acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Human3R: Everyone Everywhere All at Once</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06219</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2510.06219.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yue Chen, Xingyu Chen, Yuxuan Xue, Anpei Chen, Yuliang Xiu, Gerard Pons-Moll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; We present Human3R, a unified, feed-forward framework for online 4D human-scene reconstruction, in the world frame, from casually captured monocular videos. Unlike previous approaches that rely on multi-stage pipelines, iterative contact-aware refinement between humans and scenes, and heavy dependencies, e.g., human detection, depth estimation, and SLAM pre-processing, Human3R jointly recovers global multi-person SMPL-X bodies ("everyone"), dense 3D scene ("everywhere"), and camera trajectories in a single forward pass ("all-at-once"). Our method builds upon the 4D online reconstruction model CUT3R, and uses parameter-efficient visual prompt tuning, to strive to preserve CUT3R's rich spatiotemporal priors, while enabling direct readout of multiple SMPL-X bodies. Human3R is a unified model that eliminates heavy dependencies and iterative refinement. After being trained on the relatively small-scale synthetic dataset BEDLAM for just one day on one GPU, it achieves superior performance with remarkable efficiency: it reconstructs multiple humans in a one-shot manner, along with 3D scenes, in one stage, at real-time speed (15 FPS) with a low memory footprint (8 GB). Extensive experiments demonstrate that Human3R delivers state-of-the-art or competitive performance across tasks, including global human motion estimation, local human mesh recovery, video depth estimation, and camera pose estimation, with a single unified model. We hope that Human3R will serve as a simple yet strong baseline, be easily extended for downstream applications.Code available in https://fanegg.github.io/Human3R&lt;/p&gt;</description>
