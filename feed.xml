      <title>MiniCPM-V 4.5: Cooking Efficient MLLMs via Architecture, Data, and   Training Recipe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18154</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2509.18154.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Tianyu Yu, Zefan Wang, Chongyi Wang, Fuwei Huang, Wenshuo Ma, Zhihui He, Tianchi Cai, Weize Chen, Yuxiang Huang, Yuanqian Zhao, Bokai Xu, Junbo Cui, Yingjing Xu, Liqing Ruan, Luoyuan Zhang, Hanyu Liu, Jingkun Tang, Hongyuan Liu, Qining Guo, Wenhao Hu, Bingxiang He, Jie Zhou, Jie Cai, Ji Qi, Zonghao Guo, Chi Chen, Guoyang Zeng, Yuxuan Li, Ganqu Cui, Ning Ding, Xu Han, Yuan Yao, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 31&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are undergoing rapid progress and represent the frontier of AI development. However, their training and inference efficiency have emerged as a core bottleneck in making MLLMs more accessible and scalable. To address the challenges, we present MiniCPM-V 4.5, an 8B parameter model designed for high efficiency and strong performance. We introduce three core improvements in model architecture, data strategy and training method: a unified 3D-Resampler model architecture for highly compact encoding over images and videos, a unified learning paradigm for document knowledge and text recognition without heavy data engineering, and a hybrid reinforcement learning strategy for proficiency in both short and long reasoning modes. Comprehensive experimental results in OpenCompass evaluation show that MiniCPM-V 4.5 surpasses widely used proprietary models such as GPT-4o-latest, and significantly larger open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL 72B. Notably, the strong performance is achieved with remarkable efficiency. For example, on the widely adopted VideoMME benchmark, MiniCPM-V 4.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance among models under 30B size, using just 46.7\% GPU memory cost and 8.7\% inference time of Qwen2.5-VL 7B.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Discriminate Against Speakers of German Dialects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13835</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2509.13835.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Minh Duc Bui, Carolin Holtermann, Valentin Hofmann, Anne Lauscher, Katharina von der Wense&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Dialects represent a significant component of human culture and are found across all regions of the world. In Germany, more than 40% of the population speaks a regional dialect (Adler and Hansen, 2022). However, despite cultural importance, individuals speaking dialects often face negative societal stereotypes. We examine whether such stereotypes are mirrored by large language models (LLMs). We draw on the sociolinguistic literature on dialect perception to analyze traits commonly associated with dialect speakers. Based on these traits, we assess the dialect naming bias and dialect usage bias expressed by LLMs in two tasks: an association task and a decision task. To assess a model's dialect usage bias, we construct a novel evaluation corpus that pairs sentences from seven regional German dialects (e.g., Alemannic and Bavarian) with their standard German counterparts. We find that: (1) in the association task, all evaluated LLMs exhibit significant dialect naming and dialect usage bias against German dialect speakers, reflected in negative adjective associations; (2) all models reproduce these dialect naming and dialect usage biases in their decision making; and (3) contrary to prior work showing minimal bias with explicit demographic mentions, we find that explicitly labeling linguistic demographics--German dialect speakers--amplifies bias more than implicit cues like dialect usage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Baseer: A Vision-Language Model for Arabic Document-to-Markdown OCR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18174</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2509.18174.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Khalil Hennara, Muhammad Hreden, Mohamed Motasim Hamed, Ahmad Bastati, Zeina Aldallal, Sara Chrouf, Safwan AlModhayan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 82&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Arabic document OCR remains a challenging task due to the language's cursive script, diverse fonts, diacritics, and right-to-left orientation. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced document understanding for high-resource languages, their performance on Arabic remains limited. In this work, we introduce Baseer, a vision-language model fine- tuned specifically for Arabic document OCR. Leveraging a large-scale dataset combining synthetic and real-world documents, Baseer is trained using a decoder-only fine-tuning strategy to adapt a pre-trained MLLM while preserving general visual features. We also present Misraj-DocOCR, a high-quality, expert-verified benchmark designed for rigorous evaluation of Arabic OCR systems. Our experiments show that Baseer significantly outperforms existing open-source and commercial solutions, achieving a WER of 0.25 and establishing a new state-of-the-art in the domain of Arabic document OCR. Our results highlight the benefits of domain-specific adaptation of general-purpose MLLMs and establish a strong baseline for high-accuracy OCR on morphologically rich languages like Arabic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>CommonForms: A Large, Diverse Dataset for Form Field Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16506</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2509.16506.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Joe Barrow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; This paper introduces CommonForms, a web-scale dataset for form field detection. It casts the problem of form field detection as object detection: given an image of a page, predict the location and type (Text Input, Choice Button, Signature) of form fields. The dataset is constructed by filtering Common Crawl to find PDFs that have fillable elements. Starting with 8 million documents, the filtering process is used to arrive at a final dataset of roughly 55k documents that have over 450k pages. Analysis shows that the dataset contains a diverse mixture of languages and domains; one third of the pages are non-English, and among the 14 classified domains, no domain makes up more than 25% of the dataset.   In addition, this paper presents a family of form field detectors, FFDNet-Small and FFDNet-Large, which attain a very high average precision on the CommonForms test set. Each model cost less than $500 to train. Ablation results show that high-resolution inputs are crucial for high-quality form field detection, and that the cleaning process improves data efficiency over using all PDFs that have fillable fields in Common Crawl. A qualitative analysis shows that they outperform a popular, commercially available PDF reader that can prepare forms. Unlike the most popular commercially available solutions, FFDNet can predict checkboxes in addition to text and signature fields. This is, to our knowledge, the first large scale dataset released for form field detection, as well as the first open source models. The dataset, models, and code will be released at https://github.com/jbarrow/commonforms&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>HyRF: Hybrid Radiance Fields for Memory-efficient and High-quality Novel   View Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17083</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2509.17083.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Zipeng Wang, Dan Xu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful alternative to NeRF-based approaches, enabling real-time, high-quality novel view synthesis through explicit, optimizable 3D Gaussians. However, 3DGS suffers from significant memory overhead due to its reliance on per-Gaussian parameters to model view-dependent effects and anisotropic shapes. While recent works propose compressing 3DGS with neural fields, these methods struggle to capture high-frequency spatial variations in Gaussian properties, leading to degraded reconstruction of fine details. We present Hybrid Radiance Fields (HyRF), a novel scene representation that combines the strengths of explicit Gaussians and neural fields. HyRF decomposes the scene into (1) a compact set of explicit Gaussians storing only critical high-frequency parameters and (2) grid-based neural fields that predict remaining properties. To enhance representational capacity, we introduce a decoupled neural field architecture, separately modeling geometry (scale, opacity, rotation) and view-dependent color. Additionally, we propose a hybrid rendering scheme that composites Gaussian splatting with a neural field-predicted background, addressing limitations in distant scene representation. Experiments demonstrate that HyRF achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality while reducing model size by over 20 times compared to 3DGS and maintaining real-time performance.

      <title>OpenGVL - Benchmarking Visual Temporal Progress for Data Curation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17321</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2509.17321.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Paweł Budzianowski, Emilia Wiśnios, Gracjan Góral, Igor Kulakov, Viktor Petrenko, Krzysztof Walas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Data scarcity remains one of the most limiting factors in driving progress in robotics. However, the amount of available robotics data in the wild is growing exponentially, creating new opportunities for large-scale data utilization. Reliable temporal task completion prediction could help automatically annotate and curate this data at scale. The Generative Value Learning (GVL) approach was recently proposed, leveraging the knowledge embedded in vision-language models (VLMs) to predict task progress from visual observations. Building upon GVL, we propose OpenGVL, a comprehensive benchmark for estimating task progress across diverse challenging manipulation tasks involving both robotic and human embodiments. We evaluate the capabilities of publicly available open-source foundation models, showing that open-source model families significantly underperform closed-source counterparts, achieving only approximately 70% of their performance on temporal progress prediction tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate how OpenGVL can serve as a practical tool for automated data curation and filtering, enabling efficient quality assessment of large-scale robotics datasets. We release the benchmark along with the complete codebase at github.com/budzianowski/opengvl{OpenGVL}.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Better Late Than Never: Evaluation of Latency Metrics for Simultaneous   Speech-to-Text Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17349</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2509.17349.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Peter Polák, Sara Papi, Luisa Bentivogli, Ondřej Bojar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Simultaneous speech-to-text translation (SimulST) systems have to balance translation quality with latency--the delay between speech input and the translated output. While quality evaluation is well established, accurate latency measurement remains a challenge. Existing metrics often produce inconsistent or misleading results, especially in the widely used short-form setting, where speech is artificially presegmented. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive analysis of SimulST latency metrics across language pairs, systems, and both short- and long-form regimes. We uncover a structural bias in current metrics related to segmentation that undermines fair and meaningful comparisons. To address this, we introduce YAAL (Yet Another Average Lagging), a refined latency metric that delivers more accurate evaluations in the short-form regime. We extend YAAL to LongYAAL for unsegmented audio and propose SoftSegmenter, a novel resegmentation tool based on word-level alignment. Our experiments show that YAAL and LongYAAL outperform popular latency metrics, while SoftSegmenter enhances alignment quality in long-form evaluation, together enabling more reliable assessments of SimulST systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>RadEval: A framework for radiology text evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18030</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2509.18030.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Justin Xu, Xi Zhang, Javid Abderezaei, Julie Bauml, Roger Boodoo, Fatemeh Haghighi, Ali Ganjizadeh, Eric Brattain, Dave Van Veen, Zaiqiao Meng, David Eyre, Jean-Benoit Delbrouck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce RadEval, a unified, open-source framework for evaluating radiology texts. RadEval consolidates a diverse range of metrics, from classic n-gram overlap (BLEU, ROUGE) and contextual measures (BERTScore) to clinical concept-based scores (F1CheXbert, F1RadGraph, RaTEScore, SRR-BERT, TemporalEntityF1) and advanced LLM-based evaluators (GREEN). We refine and standardize implementations, extend GREEN to support multiple imaging modalities with a more lightweight model, and pretrain a domain-specific radiology encoder, demonstrating strong zero-shot retrieval performance. We also release a richly annotated expert dataset with over 450 clinically significant error labels and show how different metrics correlate with radiologist judgment. Finally, RadEval provides statistical testing tools and baseline model evaluations across multiple publicly available datasets, facilitating reproducibility and robust benchmarking in radiology report generation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>GeoSVR: Taming Sparse Voxels for Geometrically Accurate Surface   Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18090</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2509.18090.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Jiahe Li, Jiawei Zhang, Youmin Zhang, Xiao Bai, Jin Zheng, Xiaohan Yu, Lin Gu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Reconstructing accurate surfaces with radiance fields has achieved remarkable progress in recent years. However, prevailing approaches, primarily based on Gaussian Splatting, are increasingly constrained by representational bottlenecks. In this paper, we introduce GeoSVR, an explicit voxel-based framework that explores and extends the under-investigated potential of sparse voxels for achieving accurate, detailed, and complete surface reconstruction. As strengths, sparse voxels support preserving the coverage completeness and geometric clarity, while corresponding challenges also arise from absent scene constraints and locality in surface refinement. To ensure correct scene convergence, we first propose a Voxel-Uncertainty Depth Constraint that maximizes the effect of monocular depth cues while presenting a voxel-oriented uncertainty to avoid quality degradation, enabling effective and robust scene constraints yet preserving highly accurate geometries. Subsequently, Sparse Voxel Surface Regularization is designed to enhance geometric consistency for tiny voxels and facilitate the voxel-based formation of sharp and accurate surfaces. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superior performance compared to existing methods across diverse challenging scenarios, excelling in geometric accuracy, detail preservation, and reconstruction completeness while maintaining high efficiency.

      <title>PEEK: Guiding and Minimal Image Representations for Zero-Shot   Generalization of Robot Manipulation Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18282</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2509.18282.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Jesse Zhang, Marius Memmel, Kevin Kim, Dieter Fox, Jesse Thomason, Fabio Ramos, Erdem Bıyık, Abhishek Gupta, Anqi Li&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Robotic manipulation policies often fail to generalize because they must simultaneously learn where to attend, what actions to take, and how to execute them. We argue that high-level reasoning about where and what can be offloaded to vision-language models (VLMs), leaving policies to specialize in how to act. We present PEEK (Policy-agnostic Extraction of Essential Keypoints), which fine-tunes VLMs to predict a unified point-based intermediate representation: 1. end-effector paths specifying what actions to take, and 2. task-relevant masks indicating where to focus. These annotations are directly overlaid onto robot observations, making the representation policy-agnostic and transferable across architectures. To enable scalable training, we introduce an automatic annotation pipeline, generating labeled data across 20+ robot datasets spanning 9 embodiments. In real-world evaluations, PEEK consistently boosts zero-shot generalization, including a 41.4x real-world improvement for a 3D policy trained only in simulation, and 2-3.5x gains for both large VLAs and small manipulation policies. By letting VLMs absorb semantic and visual complexity, PEEK equips manipulation policies with the minimal cues they need--where, what, and how.

      <title>Do You Need Proprioceptive States in Visuomotor Policies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18644</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2509.18644.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Juntu Zhao, Wenbo Lu, Di Zhang, Yufeng Liu, Yushen Liang, Tianluo Zhang, Yifeng Cao, Junyuan Xie, Yingdong Hu, Shengjie Wang, Junliang Guo, Dequan Wang, Yang Gao&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 42&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Imitation-learning-based visuomotor policies have been widely used in robot manipulation, where both visual observations and proprioceptive states are typically adopted together for precise control. However, in this study, we find that this common practice makes the policy overly reliant on the proprioceptive state input, which causes overfitting to the training trajectories and results in poor spatial generalization. On the contrary, we propose the State-free Policy, removing the proprioceptive state input and predicting actions only conditioned on visual observations. The State-free Policy is built in the relative end-effector action space, and should ensure the full task-relevant visual observations, here provided by dual wide-angle wrist cameras. Empirical results demonstrate that the State-free policy achieves significantly stronger spatial generalization than the state-based policy: in real-world tasks such as pick-and-place, challenging shirt-folding, and complex whole-body manipulation, spanning multiple robot embodiments, the average success rate improves from 0\% to 85\% in height generalization and from 6\% to 64\% in horizontal generalization. Furthermore, they also show advantages in data efficiency and cross-embodiment adaptation, enhancing their practicality for real-world deployment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hyper-Bagel: A Unified Acceleration Framework for Multimodal   Understanding and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18824</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2509.18824.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yanzuo Lu, Xin Xia, Manlin Zhang, Huafeng Kuang, Jianbin Zheng, Yuxi Ren, Xuefeng Xiao&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 17&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Unified multimodal models have recently attracted considerable attention for their remarkable abilities in jointly understanding and generating diverse content. However, as contexts integrate increasingly numerous interleaved multimodal tokens, the iterative processes of diffusion denoising and autoregressive decoding impose significant computational overhead. To address this, we propose Hyper-Bagel, a unified acceleration framework designed to simultaneously speed up both multimodal understanding and generation tasks. Our approach uses a divide-and-conquer strategy, employing speculative decoding for next-token prediction and a multi-stage distillation process for diffusion denoising. The framework delivers substantial performance gains, achieving over a 2x speedup in multimodal understanding. For generative tasks, our resulting lossless 6-NFE model yields a 16.67x speedup in text-to-image generation and a 22x speedup in image editing, all while preserving the high-quality output of the original model. We further develop a highly efficient 1-NFE model that enables near real-time interactive editing and generation. By combining advanced adversarial distillation with human feedback learning, this model achieves ultimate cost-effectiveness and responsiveness, making complex multimodal interactions seamless and instantaneous.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MAPO: Mixed Advantage Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18849</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2509.18849.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Wenke Huang, Quan Zhang, Yiyang Fang, Jian Liang, Xuankun Rong, Huanjin Yao, Guancheng Wan, Ke Liang, Wenwen He, Mingjun Li, Leszek Rutkowski, Mang Ye, Bo Du, Dacheng Tao&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 18&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Recent advances in reinforcement learning for foundation models, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have significantly improved the performance of foundation models on reasoning tasks. Notably, the advantage function serves as a central mechanism in GRPO for ranking the trajectory importance. However, existing explorations encounter both advantage reversion and advantage mirror problems, which hinder the reasonable advantage allocation across different query samples. In this work, we propose an easy but effective GRPO strategy, Mixed Advantage Policy Optimization (MAPO). We reveal that the trajectory appears with different certainty and propose the advantage percent deviation for samples with high-certainty trajectories. Furthermore, we dynamically reweight the advantage function for samples with varying trajectory certainty, thereby adaptively configuring the advantage function to account for sample-specific characteristics. Comparison with related state-of-the-art methods, along with ablation studies on different advantage variants, validates the effectiveness of our approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Yet current video benchmarks focus largely on indoor scenes or short-range outdoor activities, leaving the challenges associated with long-distance travel largely unexplored. Mastering extended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation MLLMs, underpinning real-world tasks such as embodied-AI planning and navigation. To bridge this gap, we present VIR-Bench, a novel benchmark consisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a challenging task designed to evaluate and push forward MLLMs' geospatial-temporal intelligence. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high scores, underscoring the difficulty of handling videos that span extended spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth case study in which we develop a prototype travel-planning agent that leverages the insights gained from VIR-Bench. The agent's markedly improved itinerary recommendations verify that our evaluation protocol not only benchmarks models effectively but also translates into concrete performance gains in user-facing applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Multi-Spectral Learning: Reimagining a Generalist Multimodal   Gemini 2.5 Model for Remote Sensing Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19087</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2509.19087.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ganesh Mallya, Yotam Gigi, Dahun Kim, Maxim Neumann, Genady Beryozkin, Tomer Shekel, Anelia Angelova&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Multi-spectral imagery plays a crucial role in diverse Remote Sensing applications including land-use classification, environmental monitoring and urban planning. These images are widely adopted because their additional spectral bands correlate strongly with physical materials on the ground, such as ice, water, and vegetation. This allows for more accurate identification, and their public availability from missions, such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat, only adds to their value. Currently, the automatic analysis of such data is predominantly managed through machine learning models specifically trained for multi-spectral input, which are costly to train and support. Furthermore, although providing a lot of utility for Remote Sensing, such additional inputs cannot be used with powerful generalist large multimodal models, which are capable of solving many visual problems, but are not able to understand specialized multi-spectral signals.   To address this, we propose a training-free approach which introduces new multi-spectral data in a Zero-Shot-only mode, as inputs to generalist multimodal models, trained on RGB-only inputs. Our approach leverages the multimodal models' understanding of the visual space, and proposes to adapt to inputs to that space, and to inject domain-specific information as instructions into the model. We exemplify this idea with the Gemini2.5 model and observe strong Zero-Shot performance gains of the approach on popular Remote Sensing benchmarks for land cover and land use classification and demonstrate the easy adaptability of Gemini2.5 to new inputs. These results highlight the potential for geospatial professionals, working with non-standard specialized inputs, to easily leverage powerful multimodal models, such as Gemini2.5, to accelerate their work, benefiting from their rich reasoning and contextual capabilities, grounded in the specialized sensor data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Soft Tokens, Hard Truths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19170</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2509.19170.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Natasha Butt, Ariel Kwiatkowski, Ismail Labiad, Julia Kempe, Yann Ollivier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; The use of continuous instead of discrete tokens during the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) phase of reasoning LLMs has garnered attention recently, based on the intuition that a continuous mixture of discrete tokens could simulate a superposition of several reasoning paths simultaneously. Theoretical results have formally proven that continuous tokens have much greater expressivity and can solve specific problems more efficiently. However, practical use of continuous tokens has been limited by strong training difficulties: previous works either just use continuous tokens at inference time on a pre-trained discrete-token model, or must distill the continuous CoT from ground-truth discrete CoTs and face computational costs that limit the CoT to very few tokens.   This is the first work introducing a scalable method to learn continuous CoTs via reinforcement learning (RL), without distilling from reference discrete CoTs. We use "soft" tokens: mixtures of tokens together with noise on the input embedding to provide RL exploration. Computational overhead is minimal, enabling us to learn continuous CoTs with hundreds of tokens. On math reasoning benchmarks with Llama and Qwen models up to 8B, training with continuous CoTs match discrete-token CoTs for pass@1 and surpass them for pass@32, showing greater CoT diversity. In systematic comparisons, the best-performing scenario is to train with continuous CoT tokens then use discrete tokens for inference, meaning the "soft" models can be deployed in a standard way. Finally, we show continuous CoT RL training better preserves the predictions of the base model on out-of-domain tasks, thus providing a softer touch to the base model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19249</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2509.19249.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Siheng Li, Kejiao Li, Zenan Xu, Guanhua Huang, Evander Yang, Kun Li, Haoyuan Wu, Jiajia Wu, Zihao Zheng, Chenchen Zhang, Kun Shi, Kyrierl Deng, Qi Yi, Ruibin Xiong, Tingqiang Xu, Yuhao Jiang, Jianfeng Yan, Yuyuan Zeng, Guanghui Xu, Jinbao Xue, Zhijiang Xu, Zheng Fang, Shuai Li, Qibin Liu, Xiaoxue Li, Zhuoyu Li, Yangyu Tao, Fei Gao, Cheng Jiang, Bo Chao Wang, Kai Liu, Jianchen Zhu, Wai Lam, Wayyt Wang, Bo Zhou, Di Wang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 43&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; The growing disparity between the exponential scaling of computational resources and the finite growth of high-quality text data now constrains conventional scaling approaches for large language models (LLMs). To address this challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data (RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast to prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning, RLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to learn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement learning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) rely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this dependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data. Specifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the policy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the preceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training data, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader contexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive experiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across multiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied to Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of 3.0, 5.1, 8.1, 6.0, 6.6, and 5.3 on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and AIME25, respectively. The results further demonstrate favorable scaling behavior, suggesting strong potential for continued gains with more compute. In addition, RLPT provides a solid foundation, extending the reasoning boundaries of LLMs and enhancing RLVR performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>DRISHTIKON: A Multimodal Multilingual Benchmark for Testing Language   Models' Understanding on Indian Culture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19274</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2509.19274.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Arijit Maji, Raghvendra Kumar, Akash Ghosh, Anushka, Nemil Shah, Abhilekh Borah, Vanshika Shah, Nishant Mishra, Sriparna Saha&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce DRISHTIKON, a first-of-its-kind multimodal and multilingual benchmark centered exclusively on Indian culture, designed to evaluate the cultural understanding of generative AI systems. Unlike existing benchmarks with a generic or global scope, DRISHTIKON offers deep, fine-grained coverage across India's diverse regions, spanning 15 languages, covering all states and union territories, and incorporating over 64,000 aligned text-image pairs. The dataset captures rich cultural themes including festivals, attire, cuisines, art forms, and historical heritage amongst many more. We evaluate a wide range of vision-language models (VLMs), including open-source small and large models, proprietary systems, reasoning-specialized VLMs, and Indic-focused models, across zero-shot and chain-of-thought settings. Our results expose key limitations in current models' ability to reason over culturally grounded, multimodal inputs, particularly for low-resource languages and less-documented traditions. DRISHTIKON fills a vital gap in inclusive AI research, offering a robust testbed to advance culturally aware, multimodally competent language technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What Characterizes Effective Reasoning? Revisiting Length, Review, and   Structure of CoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19284</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2509.19284.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yunzhen Feng, Julia Kempe, Cheng Zhang, Parag Jain, Anthony Hartshorn&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 11&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Large reasoning models (LRMs) spend substantial test-time compute on long chain-of-thought (CoT) traces, but what *characterizes* an effective CoT remains unclear. While prior work reports gains from lengthening CoTs and increasing review (revisiting earlier steps) via appended *wait* tokens, recent studies suggest that shorter thinking can outperform longer traces. We therefore conduct a systematic evaluation across ten LRMs on math and scientific reasoning. Contrary to the "longer-is-better" narrative, we find that both naive CoT lengthening and increased review are associated with *lower* accuracy.   As CoT unfolds step by step, token-level metrics can conflate verbosity with process quality. We introduce a graph view of CoT to extract structure and identify a single statistic-the *Failed-Step Fraction (FSF)*, the fraction of steps in abandoned branches-that consistently outpredicts length and review ratio for correctness across models. To probe causality, we design two interventions. First, we rank candidate CoTs by each metric at test time, where FSF yields the largest pass@1 gains; second, we edit CoTs to remove failed branches, which significantly improves accuracy, indicating that failed branches bias subsequent reasoning. Taken together, these results characterize effective CoTs as those that *fail less* and support *structure-aware* test-time scaling over indiscriminately generating long CoT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lyra: Generative 3D Scene Reconstruction via Video Diffusion Model   Self-Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19296</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2509.19296.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Sherwin Bahmani, Tianchang Shen, Jiawei Ren, Jiahui Huang, Yifeng Jiang, Haithem Turki, Andrea Tagliasacchi, David B. Lindell, Zan Gojcic, Sanja Fidler, Huan Ling, Jun Gao, Xuanchi Ren&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 11&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; The ability to generate virtual environments is crucial for applications ranging from gaming to physical AI domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and industrial AI. Current learning-based 3D reconstruction methods rely on the availability of captured real-world multi-view data, which is not always readily available. Recent advancements in video diffusion models have shown remarkable imagination capabilities, yet their 2D nature limits the applications to simulation where a robot needs to navigate and interact with the environment. In this paper, we propose a self-distillation framework that aims to distill the implicit 3D knowledge in the video diffusion models into an explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, eliminating the need for multi-view training data. Specifically, we augment the typical RGB decoder with a 3DGS decoder, which is supervised by the output of the RGB decoder. In this approach, the 3DGS decoder can be purely trained with synthetic data generated by video diffusion models. At inference time, our model can synthesize 3D scenes from either a text prompt or a single image for real-time rendering. Our framework further extends to dynamic 3D scene generation from a monocular input video. Experimental results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in static and dynamic 3D scene generation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>VolSplat: Rethinking Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting with   Voxel-Aligned Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19297</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2509.19297.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Weijie Wang, Yeqing Chen, Zeyu Zhang, Hengyu Liu, Haoxiao Wang, Zhiyuan Feng, Wenkang Qin, Zheng Zhu, Donny Y. Chen, Bohan Zhuang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 13&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a highly effective solution for novel view synthesis. Existing methods predominantly rely on a pixel-aligned Gaussian prediction paradigm, where each 2D pixel is mapped to a 3D Gaussian. We rethink this widely adopted formulation and identify several inherent limitations: it renders the reconstructed 3D models heavily dependent on the number of input views, leads to view-biased density distributions, and introduces alignment errors, particularly when source views contain occlusions or low texture. To address these challenges, we introduce VolSplat, a new multi-view feed-forward paradigm that replaces pixel alignment with voxel-aligned Gaussians. By directly predicting Gaussians from a predicted 3D voxel grid, it overcomes pixel alignment's reliance on error-prone 2D feature matching, ensuring robust multi-view consistency. Furthermore, it enables adaptive control over Gaussian density based on 3D scene complexity, yielding more faithful Gaussian point clouds, improved geometric consistency, and enhanced novel-view rendering quality. Experiments on widely used benchmarks including RealEstate10K and ScanNet demonstrate that VolSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing more plausible and view-consistent Gaussian reconstructions. In addition to superior results, our approach establishes a more scalable framework for feed-forward 3D reconstruction with denser and more robust representations, paving the way for further research in wider communities. The video results, code and trained models are available on our project page: https://lhmd.top/volsplat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>CAR-Flow: Condition-Aware Reparameterization Aligns Source and Target   for Better Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19300</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2509.19300.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Chen Chen, Pengsheng Guo, Liangchen Song, Jiasen Lu, Rui Qian, Xinze Wang, Tsu-Jui Fu, Wei Liu, Yinfei Yang, Alex Schwing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Conditional generative modeling aims to learn a conditional data distribution from samples containing data-condition pairs. For this, diffusion and flow-based methods have attained compelling results. These methods use a learned (flow) model to transport an initial standard Gaussian noise that ignores the condition to the conditional data distribution. The model is hence required to learn both mass transport and conditional injection. To ease the demand on the model, we propose Condition-Aware Reparameterization for Flow Matching (CAR-Flow) -- a lightweight, learned shift that conditions the source, the target, or both distributions. By relocating these distributions, CAR-Flow shortens the probability path the model must learn, leading to faster training in practice. On low-dimensional synthetic data, we visualize and quantify the effects of CAR. On higher-dimensional natural image data (ImageNet-256), equipping SiT-XL/2 with CAR-Flow reduces FID from 2.07 to 1.68, while introducing less than 0.6% additional parameters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
