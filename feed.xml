      <title>Search and Refine During Think: Autonomous Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning   of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11277</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.11277.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yaorui Shi, Shihan Li, Chang Wu, Zhiyuan Liu, Junfeng Fang, Hengxing Cai, An Zhang, Xiang Wang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Large language models have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities but are inherently limited by their knowledge reservoir. Retrieval-augmented reasoning mitigates this limitation by allowing LLMs to query external resources, but existing methods often retrieve irrelevant or noisy information, hindering accurate reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoRefine, a reinforcement learning post-training framework that adopts a new ``search-and-refine-during-think'' paradigm. AutoRefine introduces explicit knowledge refinement steps between successive search calls, enabling the model to iteratively filter, distill, and organize evidence before generating an answer. Furthermore, we incorporate tailored retrieval-specific rewards alongside answer correctness rewards using group relative policy optimization. Experiments on single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that AutoRefine significantly outperforms existing approaches, particularly in complex, multi-hop reasoning scenarios. Detailed analysis shows that AutoRefine issues frequent, higher-quality searches and synthesizes evidence effectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>NOVA: A Benchmark for Anomaly Localization and Clinical Reasoning in   Brain MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14064</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.14064.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Cosmin I. Bercea, Jun Li, Philipp Raffler, Evamaria O. Riedel, Lena Schmitzer, Angela Kurz, Felix Bitzer, Paula Roßmüller, Julian Canisius, Mirjam L. Beyrle, Che Liu, Wenjia Bai, Bernhard Kainz, Julia A. Schnabel, Benedikt Wiestler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 16&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; In many real-world applications, deployed models encounter inputs that differ from the data seen during training. Out-of-distribution detection identifies whether an input stems from an unseen distribution, while open-world recognition flags such inputs to ensure the system remains robust as ever-emerging, previously unknown categories appear and must be addressed without retraining. Foundation and vision-language models are pre-trained on large and diverse datasets with the expectation of broad generalization across domains, including medical imaging. However, benchmarking these models on test sets with only a few common outlier types silently collapses the evaluation back to a closed-set problem, masking failures on rare or truly novel conditions encountered in clinical use.   We therefore present NOVA, a challenging, real-life evaluation-only benchmark of sim900 brain MRI scans that span 281 rare pathologies and heterogeneous acquisition protocols. Each case includes rich clinical narratives and double-blinded expert bounding-box annotations. Together, these enable joint assessment of anomaly localisation, visual captioning, and diagnostic reasoning. Because NOVA is never used for training, it serves as an extreme stress-test of out-of-distribution generalisation: models must bridge a distribution gap both in sample appearance and in semantic space. Baseline results with leading vision-language models (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Qwen2.5-VL-72B) reveal substantial performance drops across all tasks, establishing NOVA as a rigorous testbed for advancing models that can detect, localize, and reason about truly unknown anomalies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Do RAG Systems Suffer From Positional Bias?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15561</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.15561.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Florin Cuconasu, Simone Filice, Guy Horowitz, Yoelle Maarek, Fabrizio Silvestri&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM accuracy by adding passages retrieved from an external corpus to the LLM prompt. This paper investigates how positional bias - the tendency of LLMs to weight information differently based on its position in the prompt - affects not only the LLM's capability to capitalize on relevant passages, but also its susceptibility to distracting passages. Through extensive experiments on three benchmarks, we show how state-of-the-art retrieval pipelines, while attempting to retrieve relevant passages, systematically bring highly distracting ones to the top ranks, with over 60% of queries containing at least one highly distracting passage among the top-10 retrieved passages. As a result, the impact of the LLM positional bias, which in controlled settings is often reported as very prominent by related works, is actually marginal in real scenarios since both relevant and distracting passages are, in turn, penalized. Indeed, our findings reveal that sophisticated strategies that attempt to rearrange the passages based on LLM positional preferences do not perform better than random shuffling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Improving Chemical Understanding of LLMs via SMILES Parsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16340</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.16340.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yunhui Jang, Jaehyung Kim, Sungsoo Ahn&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly recognized as powerful tools for scientific discovery, particularly in molecular science. A fundamental requirement for these models is the ability to accurately understand molecular structures, commonly encoded in the SMILES representation. However, current LLMs struggle to interpret SMILES, even failing to carry out basic tasks such as counting molecular rings. To address this limitation, we introduce CLEANMOL, a novel framework that formulates SMILES parsing into a suite of clean and deterministic tasks explicitly designed to promote graph-level molecular comprehension. These tasks span from subgraph matching to global graph matching, providing structured supervision aligned with molecular structural properties. We construct a molecular pretraining dataset with adaptive difficulty scoring and pre-train open-source LLMs on these tasks. Our results show that CLEANMOL not only enhances structural comprehension but also achieves the best or competes with the baseline on the Mol-Instructions benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MMMR: Benchmarking Massive Multi-Modal Reasoning Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16459</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.16459.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Guiyao Tie, Xueyang Zhou, Tianhe Gu, Ruihang Zhang, Chaoran Hu, Sizhe Zhang, Mengqu Sun, Yan Zhang, Pan Zhou, Lichao Sun&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 35&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Recent advances in Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled unified processing of language, vision, and structured inputs, opening the door to complex tasks such as logical deduction, spatial reasoning, and scientific analysis. Despite their promise, the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, particularly those augmented with intermediate thinking traces (MLLMs-T), remain poorly understood and lack standardized evaluation benchmarks. Existing work focuses primarily on perception or final answer correctness, offering limited insight into how models reason or fail across modalities. To address this gap, we introduce the MMMR, a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate multi-modal reasoning with explicit thinking. The MMMR comprises 1) a high-difficulty dataset of 1,083 questions spanning six diverse reasoning types with symbolic depth and multi-hop demands and 2) a modular Reasoning Trace Evaluation Pipeline (RTEP) for assessing reasoning quality beyond accuracy through metrics like relevance, consistency, and structured error annotations. Empirical results show that MLLMs-T overall outperform non-thinking counterparts, but even top models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet and Gemini-2.5 Pro suffer from reasoning pathologies such as inconsistency and overthinking. This benchmark reveals persistent gaps between accuracy and reasoning quality and provides an actionable evaluation pipeline for future model development. Overall, the MMMR offers a scalable foundation for evaluating, comparing, and improving the next generation of multi-modal reasoning systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>R1-ShareVL: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability of Multimodal Large   Language Models via Share-GRPO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16673</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.16673.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Huanjin Yao, Qixiang Yin, Jingyi Zhang, Min Yang, Yibo Wang, Wenhao Wu, Fei Su, Li Shen, Minghui Qiu, Dacheng Tao, Jiaxing Huang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; In this work, we aim to incentivize the reasoning ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) and develop an effective approach that mitigates the sparse reward and advantage vanishing issues during RL. To this end, we propose Share-GRPO, a novel RL approach that tackle these issues by exploring and sharing diverse reasoning trajectories over expanded question space. Specifically, Share-GRPO first expands the question space for a given question via data transformation techniques, and then encourages MLLM to effectively explore diverse reasoning trajectories over the expanded question space and shares the discovered reasoning trajectories across the expanded questions during RL. In addition, Share-GRPO also shares reward information during advantage computation, which estimates solution advantages hierarchically across and within question variants, allowing more accurate estimation of relative advantages and improving the stability of policy training. Extensive evaluations over six widely-used reasoning benchmarks showcase the superior performance of our method. Code will be available at https://github.com/HJYao00/R1-ShareVL.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Code Graph Model (CGM): A Graph-Integrated Large Language Model for   Repository-Level Software Engineering Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16901</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.16901.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Hongyuan Tao, Ying Zhang, Zhenhao Tang, Hongen Peng, Xukun Zhu, Bingchang Liu, Yingguang Yang, Ziyin Zhang, Zhaogui Xu, Haipeng Zhang, Linchao Zhu, Rui Wang, Hang Yu, Jianguo Li, Peng Di&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 11&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in function-level code generation, yet repository-level software engineering tasks remain challenging. Current solutions predominantly rely on proprietary LLM agents, which introduce unpredictability and limit accessibility, raising concerns about data privacy and model customization. This paper investigates whether open-source LLMs can effectively address repository-level tasks without requiring agent-based approaches. We demonstrate this is possible by enabling LLMs to comprehend functions and files within codebases through their semantic information and structural dependencies. To this end, we introduce Code Graph Models (CGMs), which integrate repository code graph structures into the LLM's attention mechanism and map node attributes to the LLM's input space using a specialized adapter. When combined with an agentless graph RAG framework, our approach achieves a 43.00% resolution rate on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark using the open-source Qwen2.5-72B model. This performance ranks first among open weight models, second among methods with open-source systems, and eighth overall, surpassing the previous best open-source model-based method by 12.33%.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>R1-Searcher++: Incentivizing the Dynamic Knowledge Acquisition of LLMs   via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17005</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.17005.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Huatong Song, Jinhao Jiang, Wenqing Tian, Zhipeng Chen, Yuhuan Wu, Jiahao Zhao, Yingqian Min, Wayne Xin Zhao, Lei Fang, Ji-Rong Wen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but prone to hallucinations due to static knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps by injecting external information, but current methods often are costly, generalize poorly, or ignore the internal knowledge of the model. In this paper, we introduce R1-Searcher++, a novel framework designed to train LLMs to adaptively leverage both internal and external knowledge sources. R1-Searcher++ employs a two-stage training strategy: an initial SFT Cold-start phase for preliminary format learning, followed by RL for Dynamic Knowledge Acquisition. The RL stage uses outcome-supervision to encourage exploration, incorporates a reward mechanism for internal knowledge utilization, and integrates a memorization mechanism to continuously assimilate retrieved information, thereby enriching the model's internal knowledge. By leveraging internal knowledge and external search engine, the model continuously improves its capabilities, enabling efficient retrieval-augmented reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that R1-Searcher++ outperforms previous RAG and reasoning methods and achieves efficient retrieval. The code is available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/R1-Searcher-plus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tropical Attention: Neural Algorithmic Reasoning for Combinatorial   Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17190</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.17190.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Baran Hashemi, Kurt Pasque, Chris Teska, Ruriko Yoshida&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems work with taking maximization, minimization, and classical addition in their recursion algorithms. The associated value functions correspond to convex polyhedra in the max plus semiring. Existing Neural Algorithmic Reasoning models, however, rely on softmax-normalized dot-product attention where the smooth exponential weighting blurs these sharp polyhedral structures and collapses when evaluated on out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We introduce Tropical attention, a novel attention function that operates natively in the max-plus semiring of tropical geometry. We prove that Tropical attention can approximate tropical circuits of DP-type combinatorial algorithms. We then propose that using Tropical transformers enhances empirical OOD performance in both length generalization and value generalization, on algorithmic reasoning tasks, surpassing softmax baselines while remaining stable under adversarial attacks. We also present adversarial-attack generalization as a third axis for Neural Algorithmic Reasoning benchmarking. Our results demonstrate that Tropical attention restores the sharp, scale-invariant reasoning absent from softmax.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SweEval: Do LLMs Really Swear? A Safety Benchmark for Testing Limits for   Enterprise Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17332</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.17332.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Hitesh Laxmichand Patel, Amit Agarwal, Arion Das, Bhargava Kumar, Srikant Panda, Priyaranjan Pattnayak, Taki Hasan Rafi, Tejaswini Kumar, Dong-Kyu Chae&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 13&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Enterprise customers are increasingly adopting Large Language Models (LLMs) for critical communication tasks, such as drafting emails, crafting sales pitches, and composing casual messages. Deploying such models across different regions requires them to understand diverse cultural and linguistic contexts and generate safe and respectful responses. For enterprise applications, it is crucial to mitigate reputational risks, maintain trust, and ensure compliance by effectively identifying and handling unsafe or offensive language. To address this, we introduce SweEval, a benchmark simulating real-world scenarios with variations in tone (positive or negative) and context (formal or informal). The prompts explicitly instruct the model to include specific swear words while completing the task. This benchmark evaluates whether LLMs comply with or resist such inappropriate instructions and assesses their alignment with ethical frameworks, cultural nuances, and language comprehension capabilities. In order to advance research in building ethically aligned AI systems for enterprise use and beyond, we release the dataset and code: https://github.com/amitbcp/multilingual_profanity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MMMG: a Comprehensive and Reliable Evaluation Suite for Multitask   Multimodal Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17613</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.17613.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Jihan Yao, Yushi Hu, Yujie Yi, Bin Han, Shangbin Feng, Guang Yang, Bingbing Wen, Ranjay Krishna, Lucy Lu Wang, Yulia Tsvetkov, Noah A. Smith, Banghua Zhu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Automatically evaluating multimodal generation presents a significant challenge, as automated metrics often struggle to align reliably with human evaluation, especially for complex tasks that involve multiple modalities. To address this, we present MMMG, a comprehensive and human-aligned benchmark for multimodal generation across 4 modality combinations (image, audio, interleaved text and image, interleaved text and audio), with a focus on tasks that present significant challenges for generation models, while still enabling reliable automatic evaluation through a combination of models and programs. MMMG encompasses 49 tasks (including 29 newly developed ones), each with a carefully designed evaluation pipeline, and 937 instructions to systematically assess reasoning, controllability, and other key capabilities of multimodal generation models. Extensive validation demonstrates that MMMG is highly aligned with human evaluation, achieving an average agreement of 94.3%. Benchmarking results on 24 multimodal generation models reveal that even though the state-of-the-art model, GPT Image, achieves 78.3% accuracy for image generation, it falls short on multimodal reasoning and interleaved generation. Furthermore, results suggest considerable headroom for improvement in audio generation, highlighting an important direction for future research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PreMoe: Lightening MoEs on Constrained Memory by Expert Pruning and   Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17639</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.17639.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Zehua Pei, Ying Zhang, Hui-Ling Zhen, Xianzhi Yu, Wulong Liu, Sinno Jialin Pan, Mingxuan Yuan, Bei Yu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures enable scaling large language models (LLMs) to vast parameter counts without a proportional rise in computational costs. However, the significant memory demands of large MoE models hinder their deployment across various computational environments, from cloud servers to consumer devices. This study first demonstrates pronounced task-specific specialization in expert activation patterns within MoE layers. Building on this, we introduce PreMoe, a novel framework that enables efficient deployment of massive MoE models in memory-constrained environments. PreMoe features two main components: probabilistic expert pruning (PEP) and task-adaptive expert retrieval (TAER). PEP employs a new metric, the task-conditioned expected selection score (TCESS), derived from router logits to quantify expert importance for specific tasks, thereby identifying a minimal set of critical experts. TAER leverages these task-specific expert importance profiles for efficient inference. It pre-computes and stores compact expert patterns for diverse tasks. When a user query is received, TAER rapidly identifies the most relevant stored task pattern and reconstructs the model by loading only the small subset of experts crucial for that task. This approach dramatically reduces the memory footprint across all deployment scenarios. DeepSeek-R1 671B maintains 97.2\% accuracy on MATH500 when pruned to 8/128 configuration (50\% expert reduction), and still achieves 72.0\% with aggressive 8/32 pruning (87.5\% expert reduction). Pangu-Ultra-MoE 718B achieves 97.15\% on MATH500 and 81.3\% on AIME24 with 8/128 pruning, while even more aggressive pruning to 4/64 (390GB memory) preserves 96.95\% accuracy on MATH500. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/JarvisPei/PreMoe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Don't Overthink it. Preferring Shorter Thinking Chains for Improved LLM   Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17813</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.17813.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Michael Hassid, Gabriel Synnaeve, Yossi Adi, Roy Schwartz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 39&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Reasoning large language models (LLMs) heavily rely on scaling test-time compute to perform complex reasoning tasks by generating extensive "thinking" chains. While demonstrating impressive results, this approach incurs significant computational costs and inference time. In this work, we challenge the assumption that long thinking chains results in better reasoning capabilities. We first demonstrate that shorter reasoning chains within individual questions are significantly more likely to yield correct answers - up to 34.5% more accurate than the longest chain sampled for the same question. Based on these results, we suggest short-m@k, a novel reasoning LLM inference method. Our method executes k independent generations in parallel and halts computation once the first m thinking processes are done. The final answer is chosen using majority voting among these m chains. Basic short-1@k demonstrates similar or even superior performance over standard majority voting in low-compute settings - using up to 40% fewer thinking tokens. short-3@k, while slightly less efficient than short-1@k, consistently surpasses majority voting across all compute budgets, while still being substantially faster (up to 33% wall time reduction). Inspired by our results, we finetune an LLM using short, long, and randomly selected reasoning chains. We then observe that training on the shorter ones leads to better performance. Our findings suggest rethinking current methods of test-time compute in reasoning LLMs, emphasizing that longer "thinking" does not necessarily translate to improved performance and can, counter-intuitively, lead to degraded results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Explaining Sources of Uncertainty in Automated Fact-Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17855</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.17855.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Jingyi Sun, Greta Warren, Irina Shklovski, Isabelle Augenstein&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Understanding sources of a model's uncertainty regarding its predictions is crucial for effective human-AI collaboration. Prior work proposes using numerical uncertainty or hedges ("I'm not sure, but ..."), which do not explain uncertainty that arises from conflicting evidence, leaving users unable to resolve disagreements or rely on the output. We introduce CLUE (Conflict-and-Agreement-aware Language-model Uncertainty Explanations), the first framework to generate natural language explanations of model uncertainty by (i) identifying relationships between spans of text that expose claim-evidence or inter-evidence conflicts and agreements that drive the model's predictive uncertainty in an unsupervised way, and (ii) generating explanations via prompting and attention steering that verbalize these critical interactions. Across three language models and two fact-checking datasets, we show that CLUE produces explanations that are more faithful to the model's uncertainty and more consistent with fact-checking decisions than prompting for uncertainty explanations without span-interaction guidance. Human evaluators judge our explanations to be more helpful, more informative, less redundant, and more logically consistent with the input than this baseline. CLUE requires no fine-tuning or architectural changes, making it plug-and-play for any white-box language model. By explicitly linking uncertainty to evidence conflicts, it offers practical support for fact-checking and generalises readily to other tasks that require reasoning over complex information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ComfyMind: Toward General-Purpose Generation via Tree-Based Planning and   Reactive Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17908</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.17908.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Litao Guo, Xinli Xu, Luozhou Wang, Jiantao Lin, Jinsong Zhou, Zixin Zhang, Bolan Su, Ying-Cong Chen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; With the rapid advancement of generative models, general-purpose generation has gained increasing attention as a promising approach to unify diverse tasks across modalities within a single system. Despite this progress, existing open-source frameworks often remain fragile and struggle to support complex real-world applications due to the lack of structured workflow planning and execution-level feedback. To address these limitations, we present ComfyMind, a collaborative AI system designed to enable robust and scalable general-purpose generation, built on the ComfyUI platform. ComfyMind introduces two core innovations: Semantic Workflow Interface (SWI) that abstracts low-level node graphs into callable functional modules described in natural language, enabling high-level composition and reducing structural errors; Search Tree Planning mechanism with localized feedback execution, which models generation as a hierarchical decision process and allows adaptive correction at each stage. Together, these components improve the stability and flexibility of complex generative workflows. We evaluate ComfyMind on three public benchmarks: ComfyBench, GenEval, and Reason-Edit, which span generation, editing, and reasoning tasks. Results show that ComfyMind consistently outperforms existing open-source baselines and achieves performance comparable to GPT-Image-1. ComfyMind paves a promising path for the development of open-source general-purpose generative AI systems. Project page: https://github.com/LitaoGuo/ComfyMind&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Beyond Distillation: Pushing the Limits of Medical LLM Reasoning with   Minimalist Rule-Based RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17952</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.17952.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Che Liu, Haozhe Wang, Jiazhen Pan, Zhongwei Wan, Yong Dai, Fangzhen Lin, Wenjia Bai, Daniel Rueckert, Rossella Arcucci&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 17&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Improving performance on complex tasks and enabling interpretable decision making in large language models (LLMs), especially for clinical applications, requires effective reasoning. Yet this remains challenging without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on costly chain-of-thought (CoT) data distilled from closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o). In this work, we present AlphaMed, the first medical LLM to show that reasoning capability can emerge purely through reinforcement learning (RL), using minimalist rule-based rewards on public multiple-choice QA datasets, without relying on SFT or distilled CoT data. AlphaMed achieves state-of-the-art results on six medical QA benchmarks, outperforming models trained with conventional SFT+RL pipelines. On challenging benchmarks (e.g., MedXpert), AlphaMed even surpasses larger or closed-source models such as DeepSeek-V3-671B and Claude-3.5-Sonnet. To understand the factors behind this success, we conduct a comprehensive data-centric analysis guided by three questions: (i) Can minimalist rule-based RL incentivize reasoning without distilled CoT supervision? (ii) How do dataset quantity and diversity impact reasoning? (iii) How does question difficulty shape the emergence and generalization of reasoning? Our findings show that dataset informativeness is a key driver of reasoning performance, and that minimalist RL on informative, multiple-choice QA data is effective at inducing reasoning without CoT supervision. We also observe divergent trends across benchmarks, underscoring limitations in current evaluation and the need for more challenging, reasoning-oriented medical QA benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>VideoGameBench: Can Vision-Language Models complete popular video games?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18134</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.18134.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Alex L. Zhang, Thomas L. Griffiths, Karthik R. Narasimhan, Ofir Press&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved strong results on coding and math benchmarks that are challenging for humans, yet their ability to perform tasks that come naturally to humans--such as perception, spatial navigation, and memory management--remains understudied. Real video games are crafted to be intuitive for humans to learn and master by leveraging innate inductive biases, making them an ideal testbed for evaluating such capabilities in VLMs. To this end, we introduce VideoGameBench, a benchmark consisting of 10 popular video games from the 1990s that VLMs directly interact with in real-time. VideoGameBench challenges models to complete entire games with access to only raw visual inputs and a high-level description of objectives and controls, a significant departure from existing setups that rely on game-specific scaffolding and auxiliary information. We keep three of the games secret to encourage solutions that generalize to unseen environments. Our experiments show that frontier vision-language models struggle to progress beyond the beginning of each game. We find inference latency to be a major limitation of frontier models in the real-time setting; therefore, we introduce VideoGameBench Lite, a setting where the game pauses while waiting for the LM's next action. The best performing model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, completes only 0.48% of VideoGameBench and 1.6% of VideoGameBench Lite. We hope that the formalization of the human skills mentioned above into this benchmark motivates progress in these research directions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>BiomedSQL: Text-to-SQL for Scientific Reasoning on Biomedical Knowledge   Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20321</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.20321.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Mathew J. Koretsky, Maya Willey, Adi Asija, Owen Bianchi, Chelsea X. Alvarado, Tanay Nayak, Nicole Kuznetsov, Sungwon Kim, Mike A. Nalls, Daniel Khashabi, Faraz Faghri&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Biomedical researchers increasingly rely on large-scale structured databases for complex analytical tasks. However, current text-to-SQL systems often struggle to map qualitative scientific questions into executable SQL, particularly when implicit domain reasoning is required. We introduce BiomedSQL, the first benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate scientific reasoning in text-to-SQL generation over a real-world biomedical knowledge base. BiomedSQL comprises 68,000 question/SQL query/answer triples grounded in a harmonized BigQuery knowledge base that integrates gene-disease associations, causal inference from omics data, and drug approval records. Each question requires models to infer domain-specific criteria, such as genome-wide significance thresholds, effect directionality, or trial phase filtering, rather than rely on syntactic translation alone. We evaluate a range of open- and closed-source LLMs across prompting strategies and interaction paradigms. Our results reveal a substantial performance gap: GPT-o3-mini achieves 59.0% execution accuracy, while our custom multi-step agent, BMSQL, reaches 62.6%, both well below the expert baseline of 90.0%. BiomedSQL provides a new foundation for advancing text-to-SQL systems capable of supporting scientific discovery through robust reasoning over structured biomedical knowledge bases. Our dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/NIH-CARD/BiomedSQL, and our code is open-source at https://github.com/NIH-CARD/biomedsql.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Beyond Prompt Engineering: Robust Behavior Control in LLMs via Steering   Target Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20322</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.20322.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Mengru Wang, Ziwen Xu, Shengyu Mao, Shumin Deng, Zhaopeng Tu, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 13&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Precise control over language model generation is vital for ensuring both safety and reliability. Although prompt engineering and steering are commonly used to intervene in model behaviors, the vast number of parameters in models often results in highly intertwined internal representations. This interdependency can limit control precision and sometimes lead to unintended side effects. Recent research has explored the use of sparse autoencoders (SAE) to disentangle knowledge in high-dimensional spaces for steering. However, these applications have been limited to toy tasks owing to the nontrivial issue of locating atomic knowledge components. In this paper, we propose Steering Target Atoms (STA), a novel method that isolates and manipulates disentangled knowledge components to enhance safety. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Further analysis reveals that steering exhibits superior robustness and flexibility, particularly in adversarial scenarios. We also apply the steering strategy to the large reasoning model, confirming its effectiveness in precise reasoning control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Guided by Gut: Efficient Test-Time Scaling with Reinforced Intrinsic   Confidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20325</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.20325.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Amirhosein Ghasemabadi, Keith G. Mills, Baochun Li, Di Niu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 39&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods for enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning often incur substantial computational costs, primarily due to extensive reliance on external Process Reward Models (PRMs) or sampling methods like Best-of-N (BoN). This paper introduces Guided by Gut (GG), an efficient self-guided TTS framework that achieves PRM-level performance without costly external verifier models. Our method employs a lightweight tree search guided solely by intrinsic LLM signals, token-level confidence and step novelty. One critical innovation is improving the reliability of internal confidence estimates via a targeted reinforcement learning fine-tuning phase. Empirical evaluations on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that GG enables smaller models (e.g., 1.5B parameters) to achieve accuracy matching or surpassing significantly larger models (e.g., 32B-70B parameters), while reducing GPU memory usage by up to 10x. Compared to PRM-based methods, GG achieves comparable accuracy with 8x faster inference speeds and 4-5x lower memory usage. Additionally, GG reduces KV cache memory usage by approximately 50% compared to the BoN strategy, facilitating more efficient and practical deployment of TTS techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>OmniConsistency: Learning Style-Agnostic Consistency from Paired   Stylization Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18445</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.18445.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yiren Song, Cheng Liu, Mike Zheng Shou&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 57&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Diffusion models have advanced image stylization significantly, yet two core challenges persist: (1) maintaining consistent stylization in complex scenes, particularly identity, composition, and fine details, and (2) preventing style degradation in image-to-image pipelines with style LoRAs. GPT-4o's exceptional stylization consistency highlights the performance gap between open-source methods and proprietary models. To bridge this gap, we propose OmniConsistency, a universal consistency plugin leveraging large-scale Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). OmniConsistency contributes: (1) an in-context consistency learning framework trained on aligned image pairs for robust generalization; (2) a two-stage progressive learning strategy decoupling style learning from consistency preservation to mitigate style degradation; and (3) a fully plug-and-play design compatible with arbitrary style LoRAs under the Flux framework. Extensive experiments show that OmniConsistency significantly enhances visual coherence and aesthetic quality, achieving performance comparable to commercial state-of-the-art model GPT-4o.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MLLMs are Deeply Affected by Modality Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18657</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.18657.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Xu Zheng, Chenfei Liao, Yuqian Fu, Kaiyu Lei, Yuanhuiyi Lyu, Lutao Jiang, Bin Ren, Jialei Chen, Jiawen Wang, Chengxin Li, Linfeng Zhang, Danda Pani Paudel, Xuanjing Huang, Yu-Gang Jiang, Nicu Sebe, Dacheng Tao, Luc Van Gool, Xuming Hu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promising results in integrating diverse modalities such as texts and images. MLLMs are heavily influenced by modality bias, often relying on language while under-utilizing other modalities like visual inputs. This position paper argues that MLLMs are deeply affected by modality bias. Firstly, we diagnose the current state of modality bias, highlighting its manifestations across various tasks. Secondly, we propose a systematic research road-map related to modality bias in MLLMs. Thirdly, we identify key factors of modality bias in MLLMs and offer actionable suggestions for future research to mitigate it. To substantiate these findings, we conduct experiments that demonstrate the influence of each factor: 1. Data Characteristics: Language data is compact and abstract, while visual data is redundant and complex, creating an inherent imbalance in learning dynamics. 2. Imbalanced Backbone Capabilities: The dominance of pretrained language models in MLLMs leads to overreliance on language and neglect of visual information. 3. Training Objectives: Current objectives often fail to promote balanced cross-modal alignment, resulting in shortcut learning biased toward language. These findings highlight the need for balanced training strategies and model architectures to better integrate multiple modalities in MLLMs. We call for interdisciplinary efforts to tackle these challenges and drive innovation in MLLM research. Our work provides a fresh perspective on modality bias in MLLMs and offers insights for developing more robust and generalizable multimodal systems-advancing progress toward Artificial General Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sparse VideoGen2: Accelerate Video Generation with Sparse Attention via   Semantic-Aware Permutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18875</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.18875.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Shuo Yang, Haocheng Xi, Yilong Zhao, Muyang Li, Jintao Zhang, Han Cai, Yujun Lin, Xiuyu Li, Chenfeng Xu, Kelly Peng, Jianfei Chen, Song Han, Kurt Keutzer, Ion Stoica&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 34&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) are essential for video generation but suffer from significant latency due to the quadratic complexity of attention. By computing only critical tokens, sparse attention reduces computational costs and offers a promising acceleration approach. However, we identify that existing methods fail to approach optimal generation quality under the same computation budget for two reasons: (1) Inaccurate critical token identification: current methods cluster tokens based on position rather than semantics, leading to imprecise aggregated representations. (2) Excessive computation waste: critical tokens are scattered among non-critical ones, leading to wasted computation on GPUs, which are optimized for processing contiguous tokens. In this paper, we propose SVG2, a training-free framework that maximizes identification accuracy and minimizes computation waste, achieving a Pareto frontier trade-off between generation quality and efficiency. The core of SVG2 is semantic-aware permutation, which clusters and reorders tokens based on semantic similarity using k-means. This approach ensures both a precise cluster representation, improving identification accuracy, and a densified layout of critical tokens, enabling efficient computation without padding. Additionally, SVG2 integrates top-p dynamic budget control and customized kernel implementations, achieving up to 2.30x and 1.89x speedup while maintaining a PSNR of up to 30 and 26 on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MetaMind: Modeling Human Social Thoughts with Metacognitive Multi-Agent   Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18943</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.18943.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Xuanming Zhang, Yuxuan Chen, Min-Hsuan Yeh, Yixuan Li&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 21&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Human social interactions depend on the ability to infer others' unspoken intentions, emotions, and beliefs-a cognitive skill grounded in the psychological concept of Theory of Mind (ToM). While large language models (LLMs) excel in semantic understanding tasks, they struggle with the ambiguity and contextual nuance inherent in human communication. To bridge this gap, we introduce MetaMind, a multi-agent framework inspired by psychological theories of metacognition, designed to emulate human-like social reasoning. MetaMind decomposes social understanding into three collaborative stages: (1) a Theory-of-Mind Agent generates hypotheses user mental states (e.g., intent, emotion), (2) a Domain Agent refines these hypotheses using cultural norms and ethical constraints, and (3) a Response Agent generates contextually appropriate responses while validating alignment with inferred intent. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across three challenging benchmarks, with 35.7% improvement in real-world social scenarios and 6.2% gain in ToM reasoning. Notably, it enables LLMs to match human-level performance on key ToM tasks for the first time. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of all components, which showcase the framework's ability to balance contextual plausibility, social appropriateness, and user adaptation. This work advances AI systems toward human-like social intelligence, with applications in empathetic dialogue and culturally sensitive interactions.

      <title>VerIPO: Cultivating Long Reasoning in Video-LLMs via Verifier-Gudied   Iterative Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19000</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.19000.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yunxin Li, Xinyu Chen, Zitao Li, Zhenyu Liu, Longyue Wang, Wenhan Luo, Baotian Hu, Min Zhang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 35&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) shows significant promise for complex video reasoning. However, popular Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) methods, such as outcome-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are limited by data preparation bottlenecks (e.g., noise or high cost) and exhibit unstable improvements in the quality of long chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) and downstream performance.To address these limitations, we propose VerIPO, a Verifier-guided Iterative Policy Optimization method designed to gradually improve video LLMs' capacity for generating deep, long-term reasoning chains. The core component is Rollout-Aware Verifier, positioned between the GRPO and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training phases to form the GRPO-Verifier-DPO training loop. This verifier leverages small LLMs as a judge to assess the reasoning logic of rollouts, enabling the construction of high-quality contrastive data, including reflective and contextually consistent CoTs. These curated preference samples drive the efficient DPO stage (7x faster than GRPO), leading to marked improvements in reasoning chain quality, especially in terms of length and contextual consistency. This training loop benefits from GRPO's expansive search and DPO's targeted optimization. Experimental results demonstrate: 1) Significantly faster and more effective optimization compared to standard GRPO variants, yielding superior performance; 2) Our trained models exceed the direct inference of large-scale instruction-tuned Video-LLMs, producing long and contextually consistent CoTs on diverse video reasoning tasks; and 3) Our model with one iteration outperforms powerful LMMs (e.g., Kimi-VL) and long reasoning models (e.g., Video-R1), highlighting its effectiveness and stability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Recently, in the multimodal domain, works have begun to directly apply RL to generate R1-like free-form reasoning for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. However, multimodal tasks share an intrinsically different nature from textual tasks, which heavily rely on the understanding of the input image to solve the problem. Therefore, such free-form reasoning faces two critical limitations in the VQA task: (1) Extended reasoning chains diffuse visual focus away from task-critical regions, degrading answer accuracy. (2) Unverifiable intermediate steps amplify policy-gradient variance and computational costs overhead. To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce SATORI (Spatially Anchored Task Optimization with ReInforcement Learning), which decomposes VQA into three verifiable stages, including global image captioning, region localization, and answer prediction, each supplying explicit reward signals. Furthermore, we also introduce VQA-Verify, a 12k dataset annotated with answer-aligned captions and bounding-boxes to facilitate training. Experiments demonstrate consistent performance improvements across seven VQA benchmarks, achieving up to 15.7% improvement in accuracy in accuracy compared to the R1-like baseline. Our analysis of the attention map confirms enhanced focus on critical regions, which brings improvements in accuracy.

      <title>SeePhys: Does Seeing Help Thinking? -- Benchmarking Vision-Based Physics   Reasoning</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.19099.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Kun Xiang, Heng Li, Terry Jingchen Zhang, Yinya Huang, Zirong Liu, Peixin Qu, Jixi He, Jiaqi Chen, Yu-Jie Yuan, Jianhua Han, Hang Xu, Hanhui Li, Mrinmaya Sachan, Xiaodan Liang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; We present SeePhys, a large-scale multimodal benchmark for LLM reasoning grounded in physics questions ranging from middle school to PhD qualifying exams. The benchmark covers 7 fundamental domains spanning the physics discipline, incorporating 21 categories of highly heterogeneous diagrams. In contrast to prior works where visual elements mainly serve auxiliary purposes, our benchmark features a substantial proportion of vision-essential problems (75\%) that mandate visual information extraction for correct solutions. Through extensive evaluation, we observe that even the most advanced visual reasoning models (e.g., Gemini-2.5-pro and o4-mini) achieve sub-60\% accuracy on our benchmark. These results reveal fundamental challenges in current large language models' visual understanding capabilities, particularly in: (i) establishing rigorous coupling between diagram interpretation and physics reasoning, and (ii) overcoming their persistent reliance on textual cues as cognitive shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>CoreMatching: A Co-adaptive Sparse Inference Framework with Token and   Neuron Pruning for Comprehensive Acceleration of Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19235</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.19235.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Qinsi Wang, Hancheng Ye, Ming-Yu Chung, Yudong Liu, Yueqian Lin, Martin Kuo, Mingyuan Ma, Jianyi Zhang, Yiran Chen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel across diverse tasks but suffer from high inference costs in time and memory. Token sparsity mitigates inefficiencies in token usage, while neuron sparsity reduces high-dimensional computations, both offering promising solutions to enhance efficiency. Recently, these two sparsity paradigms have evolved largely in parallel, fostering the prevailing assumption that they function independently. However, a fundamental yet underexplored question remains: Do they truly operate in isolation, or is there a deeper underlying interplay that has yet to be uncovered? In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive investigation into this question. By introducing and analyzing the matching mechanism between Core Neurons and Core Tokens, we found that key neurons and tokens for inference mutually influence and reinforce each other. Building on this insight, we propose CoreMatching, a co-adaptive sparse inference framework, which leverages the synergy between token and neuron sparsity to enhance inference efficiency. Through theoretical analysis and efficiency evaluations, we demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on ten image understanding tasks and three hardware devices. Notably, on the NVIDIA Titan Xp, it achieved 5x FLOPs reduction and a 10x overall speedup. Code is released at https://github.com/wangqinsi1/2025-ICML-CoreMatching/tree/main.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SoloSpeech: Enhancing Intelligibility and Quality in Target Speech   Extraction through a Cascaded Generative Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19314</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.19314.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Helin Wang, Jiarui Hai, Dongchao Yang, Chen Chen, Kai Li, Junyi Peng, Thomas Thebaud, Laureano Moro Velazquez, Jesus Villalba, Najim Dehak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Target Speech Extraction (TSE) aims to isolate a target speaker's voice from a mixture of multiple speakers by leveraging speaker-specific cues, typically provided as auxiliary audio (a.k.a. cue audio). Although recent advancements in TSE have primarily employed discriminative models that offer high perceptual quality, these models often introduce unwanted artifacts, reduce naturalness, and are sensitive to discrepancies between training and testing environments. On the other hand, generative models for TSE lag in perceptual quality and intelligibility. To address these challenges, we present SoloSpeech, a novel cascaded generative pipeline that integrates compression, extraction, reconstruction, and correction processes. SoloSpeech features a speaker-embedding-free target extractor that utilizes conditional information from the cue audio's latent space, aligning it with the mixture audio's latent space to prevent mismatches. Evaluated on the widely-used Libri2Mix dataset, SoloSpeech achieves the new state-of-the-art intelligibility and quality in target speech extraction and speech separation tasks while demonstrating exceptional generalization on out-of-domain data and real-world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Absolute Coordinates Make Motion Generation Easy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19377</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.19377.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Zichong Meng, Zeyu Han, Xiaogang Peng, Yiming Xie, Huaizu Jiang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; State-of-the-art text-to-motion generation models rely on the kinematic-aware, local-relative motion representation popularized by HumanML3D, which encodes motion relative to the pelvis and to the previous frame with built-in redundancy. While this design simplifies training for earlier generation models, it introduces critical limitations for diffusion models and hinders applicability to downstream tasks. In this work, we revisit the motion representation and propose a radically simplified and long-abandoned alternative for text-to-motion generation: absolute joint coordinates in global space. Through systematic analysis of design choices, we show that this formulation achieves significantly higher motion fidelity, improved text alignment, and strong scalability, even with a simple Transformer backbone and no auxiliary kinematic-aware losses. Moreover, our formulation naturally supports downstream tasks such as text-driven motion control and temporal/spatial editing without additional task-specific reengineering and costly classifier guidance generation from control signals. Finally, we demonstrate promising generalization to directly generate SMPL-H mesh vertices in motion from text, laying a strong foundation for future research and motion-related applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Can Compressed LLMs Truly Act? An Empirical Evaluation of Agentic   Capabilities in LLM Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19433</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.19433.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Peijie Dong, Zhenheng Tang, Xiang Liu, Lujun Li, Xiaowen Chu, Bo Li&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Post-training compression reduces the computational and memory costs of large language models (LLMs), enabling resource-efficient deployment. However, existing compression benchmarks only focus on language modeling (e.g., perplexity) and natural language understanding tasks (e.g., GLUE accuracy), ignoring the agentic capabilities - workflow, tool use/function call, long-context understanding and real-world application. We introduce the Agent Compression Benchmark (ACBench), the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how compression impacts LLMs' agentic abilities. ACBench spans (1) 12 tasks across 4 capabilities (e.g., WorfBench for workflow generation, Needle-in-Haystack for long-context retrieval), (2) quantization (GPTQ, AWQ) and pruning (Wanda, SparseGPT), and (3) 15 models, including small (Gemma-2B), standard (Qwen2.5 7B-32B), and distilled reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1-Distill). Our experiments reveal compression tradeoffs: 4-bit quantization preserves workflow generation and tool use (1%-3% drop) but degrades real-world application accuracy by 10%-15%. We introduce ERank, Top-k Ranking Correlation and Energy to systematize analysis. ACBench provides actionable insights for optimizing LLM compression in agentic scenarios. The code can be found in https://github.com/pprp/ACBench.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>GraLoRA: Granular Low-Rank Adaptation for Parameter-Efficient   Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20355</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.20355.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yeonjoon Jung, Daehyun Ahn, Hyungjun Kim, Taesu Kim, Eunhyeok Park&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 28&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a popular method for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of generative models, valued for its simplicity and effectiveness. Despite recent enhancements, LoRA still suffers from a fundamental limitation: overfitting when the bottleneck is widened. It performs best at ranks 32-64, yet its accuracy stagnates or declines at higher ranks, still falling short of full fine-tuning (FFT) performance. We identify the root cause as LoRA's structural bottleneck, which introduces gradient entanglement to the unrelated input channels and distorts gradient propagation. To address this, we introduce a novel structure, Granular Low-Rank Adaptation (GraLoRA) that partitions weight matrices into sub-blocks, each with its own low-rank adapter. With negligible computational or storage cost, GraLoRA overcomes LoRA's limitations, effectively increases the representational capacity, and more closely approximates FFT behavior. Experiments on code generation and commonsense reasoning benchmarks show that GraLoRA consistently outperforms LoRA and other baselines, achieving up to +8.5% absolute gain in Pass@1 on HumanEval+. These improvements hold across model sizes and rank settings, making GraLoRA a scalable and robust solution for PEFT. Code, data, and scripts are available at https://github.com/SqueezeBits/GraLoRA.git&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SynLogic: Synthesizing Verifiable Reasoning Data at Scale for Learning   Logical Reasoning and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19641</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.19641.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Junteng Liu, Yuanxiang Fan, Zhuo Jiang, Han Ding, Yongyi Hu, Chi Zhang, Yiqi Shi, Shitong Weng, Aili Chen, Shiqi Chen, Yunan Huang, Mozhi Zhang, Pengyu Zhao, Junjie Yan, Junxian He&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 42&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Recent advances such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek R1 have demonstrated the potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance reasoning abilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). While open-source replication efforts have primarily focused on mathematical and coding domains, methods and resources for developing general reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. This gap is partly due to the challenge of collecting diverse and verifiable reasoning data suitable for RL. We hypothesize that logical reasoning is critical for developing general reasoning capabilities, as logic forms a fundamental building block of reasoning. In this work, we present SynLogic, a data synthesis framework and dataset that generates diverse logical reasoning data at scale, encompassing 35 diverse logical reasoning tasks. The SynLogic approach enables controlled synthesis of data with adjustable difficulty and quantity. Importantly, all examples can be verified by simple rules, making them ideally suited for RL with verifiable rewards. In our experiments, we validate the effectiveness of RL training on the SynLogic dataset based on 7B and 32B models. SynLogic leads to state-of-the-art logical reasoning performance among open-source datasets, surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B by 6 points on BBEH. Furthermore, mixing SynLogic data with mathematical and coding tasks improves the training efficiency of these domains and significantly enhances reasoning generalization. Notably, our mixed training model outperforms DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B across multiple benchmarks. These findings position SynLogic as a valuable resource for advancing the broader reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We open-source both the data synthesis pipeline and the SynLogic dataset at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/SynLogic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Modality Curation: Building Universal Embeddings for Advanced Multimodal   Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19650</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.19650.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Fanheng Kong, Jingyuan Zhang, Yahui Liu, Hongzhi Zhang, Shi Feng, Xiaocui Yang, Daling Wang, Yu Tian, Victoria W., Fuzheng Zhang, Guorui Zhou&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Multimodal information retrieval (MIR) faces inherent challenges due to the heterogeneity of data sources and the complexity of cross-modal alignment. While previous studies have identified modal gaps in feature spaces, a systematic approach to address these challenges remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce UNITE, a universal framework that tackles these challenges through two critical yet underexplored aspects: data curation and modality-aware training configurations. Our work provides the first comprehensive analysis of how modality-specific data properties influence downstream task performance across diverse scenarios. Moreover, we propose Modal-Aware Masked Contrastive Learning (MAMCL) to mitigate the competitive relationships among the instances of different modalities. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple multimodal retrieval benchmarks, outperforming existing methods by notable margins. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that strategic modality curation and tailored training protocols are pivotal for robust cross-modal representation learning. This work not only advances MIR performance but also provides a foundational blueprint for future research in multimodal systems.

      <title>ScienceBoard: Evaluating Multimodal Autonomous Agents in Realistic   Scientific Workflows</title>

Recently, various LLM-based agents have been developed to assist scientific discovery progress across multiple aspects and domains. Among these, computer-using agents, capable of interacting with operating systems as humans do, are paving the way to automated scientific problem-solving and addressing routines in researchers' workflows. Recognizing the transformative potential of these agents, we introduce ScienceBoard, which encompasses two complementary contributions: (i) a realistic, multi-domain environment featuring dynamic and visually rich scientific workflows with integrated professional software, where agents can autonomously interact via different interfaces to accelerate complex research tasks and experiments; and (ii) a challenging benchmark of 169 high-quality, rigorously validated real-world tasks curated by humans, spanning scientific-discovery workflows in domains such as biochemistry, astronomy, and geoinformatics. Extensive evaluations of agents with state-of-the-art backbones (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3.7, UI-TARS) show that, despite some promising results, they still fall short of reliably assisting scientists in complex workflows, achieving only a 15% overall success rate. In-depth analysis further provides valuable insights for addressing current agent limitations and more effective design principles, paving the way to build more capable agents for scientific discovery. Our code, environment, and benchmark are at https://qiushisun.github.io/ScienceBoard-Home/.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>An Explainable Diagnostic Framework for Neurodegenerative Dementias via   Reinforcement-Optimized LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19954</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.19954.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Andrew Zamai, Nathanael Fijalkow, Boris Mansencal, Laurent Simon, Eloi Navet, Pierrick Coupe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; The differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementias is a challenging clinical task, mainly because of the overlap in symptom presentation and the similarity of patterns observed in structural neuroimaging. To improve diagnostic efficiency and accuracy, deep learning-based methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers have been proposed for the automatic classification of brain MRIs. However, despite their strong predictive performance, these models find limited clinical utility due to their opaque decision making. In this work, we propose a framework that integrates two core components to enhance diagnostic transparency. First, we introduce a modular pipeline for converting 3D T1-weighted brain MRIs into textual radiology reports. Second, we explore the potential of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist clinicians in the differential diagnosis between Frontotemporal dementia subtypes, Alzheimer's disease, and normal aging based on the generated reports. To bridge the gap between predictive accuracy and explainability, we employ reinforcement learning to incentivize diagnostic reasoning in LLMs. Without requiring supervised reasoning traces or distillation from larger models, our approach enables the emergence of structured diagnostic rationales grounded in neuroimaging findings. Unlike post-hoc explainability methods that retrospectively justify model decisions, our framework generates diagnostic rationales as part of the inference process-producing causally grounded explanations that inform and guide the model's decision-making process. In doing so, our framework matches the diagnostic performance of existing deep learning methods while offering rationales that support its diagnostic conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>DFIR-Metric: A Benchmark Dataset for Evaluating Large Language Models in   Digital Forensics and Incident Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19973</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.19973.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Bilel Cherif, Tamas Bisztray, Richard A. Dubniczky, Aaesha Aldahmani, Saeed Alshehhi, Norbert Tihanyi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) involves analyzing digital evidence to support legal investigations. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities in DFIR tasks such as log analysis and memory forensics, but their susceptibility to errors and hallucinations raises concerns in high-stakes contexts. Despite growing interest, there is no comprehensive benchmark to evaluate LLMs across both theoretical and practical DFIR domains. To address this gap, we present DFIR-Metric, a benchmark with three components: (1) Knowledge Assessment: a set of 700 expert-reviewed multiple-choice questions sourced from industry-standard certifications and official documentation; (2) Realistic Forensic Challenges: 150 CTF-style tasks testing multi-step reasoning and evidence correlation; and (3) Practical Analysis: 500 disk and memory forensics cases from the NIST Computer Forensics Tool Testing Program (CFTT). We evaluated 14 LLMs using DFIR-Metric, analyzing both their accuracy and consistency across trials. We also introduce a new metric, the Task Understanding Score (TUS), designed to more effectively evaluate models in scenarios where they achieve near-zero accuracy. This benchmark offers a rigorous, reproducible foundation for advancing AI in digital forensics. All scripts, artifacts, and results are available on the project website at https://github.com/DFIR-Metric.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Beyond Simple Concatenation: Fairly Assessing PLM Architectures for   Multi-Chain Protein-Protein Interactions Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20036</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.20036.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Hazem Alsamkary, Mohamed Elshaffei, Mohamed Soudy, Sara Ossman, Abdallah Amr, Nehal Adel Abdelsalam, Mohamed Elkerdawy, Ahmed Elnaggar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are fundamental to numerous cellular processes, and their characterization is vital for understanding disease mechanisms and guiding drug discovery. While protein language models (PLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in predicting protein structure and function, their application to sequence-based PPI binding affinity prediction remains relatively underexplored. This gap is often attributed to the scarcity of high-quality, rigorously refined datasets and the reliance on simple strategies for concatenating protein representations. In this work, we address these limitations. First, we introduce a meticulously curated version of the PPB-Affinity dataset of a total of 8,207 unique protein-protein interaction entries, by resolving annotation inconsistencies and duplicate entries for multi-chain protein interactions. This dataset incorporates a stringent, less than or equal to 30%, sequence identity threshold to ensure robust splitting into training, validation, and test sets, minimizing data leakage. Second, we propose and systematically evaluate four architectures for adapting PLMs to PPI binding affinity prediction: embeddings concatenation (EC), sequences concatenation (SC), hierarchical pooling (HP), and pooled attention addition (PAD). These architectures were assessed using two training methods: full fine-tuning and a lightweight approach employing ConvBERT heads over frozen PLM features. Our comprehensive experiments across multiple leading PLMs (ProtT5, ESM2, Ankh, Ankh2, and ESM3) demonstrated that the HP and PAD architectures consistently outperform conventional concatenation methods, achieving up to 12% increase in terms of Spearman correlation. These results highlight the necessity of sophisticated architectural designs to fully exploit the capabilities of PLMs for nuanced PPI binding affinity prediction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, the capability of PLMs to fully capture information on protein sequences might be limited by focusing on single pre-training tasks. Although adding data modalities or supervised objectives can improve the performance of PLMs, pre-training often remains focused on denoising corrupted sequences. To push the boundaries of PLMs, our research investigated a multi-task pre-training strategy. We developed Ankh3, a model jointly optimized on two objectives: masked language modeling with multiple masking probabilities and protein sequence completion relying only on protein sequences as input. This multi-task pre-training demonstrated that PLMs can learn richer and more generalizable representations solely from protein sequences. The results demonstrated improved performance in downstream tasks, such as secondary structure prediction, fluorescence, GB1 fitness, and contact prediction. The integration of multiple tasks gave the model a more comprehensive understanding of protein properties, leading to more robust and accurate predictions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Capability-Based Scaling Laws for LLM Red-Teaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20162</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.20162.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Alexander Panfilov, Paul Kassianik, Maksym Andriushchenko, Jonas Geiping&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; As large language models grow in capability and agency, identifying vulnerabilities through red-teaming becomes vital for safe deployment. However, traditional prompt-engineering approaches may prove ineffective once red-teaming turns into a weak-to-strong problem, where target models surpass red-teamers in capabilities. To study this shift, we frame red-teaming through the lens of the capability gap between attacker and target. We evaluate more than 500 attacker-target pairs using LLM-based jailbreak attacks that mimic human red-teamers across diverse families, sizes, and capability levels. Three strong trends emerge: (i) more capable models are better attackers, (ii) attack success drops sharply once the target's capability exceeds the attacker's, and (iii) attack success rates correlate with high performance on social science splits of the MMLU-Pro benchmark. From these trends, we derive a jailbreaking scaling law that predicts attack success for a fixed target based on attacker-target capability gap. These findings suggest that fixed-capability attackers (e.g., humans) may become ineffective against future models, increasingly capable open-source models amplify risks for existing systems, and model providers must accurately measure and control models' persuasive and manipulative abilities to limit their effectiveness as attackers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ImgEdit: A Unified Image Editing Dataset and Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20275</link>

However, open-source image-editing models still lag behind their proprietary counterparts, primarily due to limited high-quality data and insufficient benchmarks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ImgEdit, a large-scale, high-quality image-editing dataset comprising 1.2 million carefully curated edit pairs, which contain both novel and complex single-turn edits, as well as challenging multi-turn tasks. To ensure the data quality, we employ a multi-stage pipeline that integrates a cutting-edge vision-language model, a detection model, a segmentation model, alongside task-specific in-painting procedures and strict post-processing. ImgEdit surpasses existing datasets in both task novelty and data quality. Using ImgEdit, we train ImgEdit-E1, an editing model using Vision Language Model to process the reference image and editing prompt, which outperforms existing open-source models on multiple tasks, highlighting the value of ImgEdit and model design. For comprehensive evaluation, we introduce ImgEdit-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate image editing performance in terms of instruction adherence, editing quality, and detail preservation. It includes a basic testsuite, a challenging single-turn suite, and a dedicated multi-turn suite. We evaluate both open-source and proprietary models, as well as ImgEdit-E1, providing deep analysis and actionable insights into the current behavior of image-editing models. The source data are publicly available on https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/ImgEdit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>VLM-3R: Vision-Language Models Augmented with Instruction-Aligned 3D   Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20279</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.20279.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Zhiwen Fan, Jian Zhang, Renjie Li, Junge Zhang, Runjin Chen, Hezhen Hu, Kevin Wang, Huaizhi Qu, Dilin Wang, Zhicheng Yan, Hongyu Xu, Justin Theiss, Tianlong Chen, Jiachen Li, Zhengzhong Tu, Zhangyang Wang, Rakesh Ranjan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; The rapid advancement of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for 2D images and videos has motivated extending these models to understand 3D scenes, aiming for human-like visual-spatial intelligence. Nevertheless, achieving deep spatial understanding comparable to human capabilities poses significant challenges in model encoding and data acquisition. Existing methods frequently depend on external depth sensors for geometry capture or utilize off-the-shelf algorithms for pre-constructing 3D maps, thereby limiting their scalability, especially with prevalent monocular video inputs and for time-sensitive applications. In this work, we introduce VLM-3R, a unified framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that incorporates 3D Reconstructive instruction tuning. VLM-3R processes monocular video frames by employing a geometry encoder to derive implicit 3D tokens that represent spatial understanding. Leveraging our Spatial-Visual-View Fusion and over 200K curated 3D reconstructive instruction tuning question-answer (QA) pairs, VLM-3R effectively aligns real-world spatial context with language instructions. This enables monocular 3D spatial assistance and embodied reasoning. To facilitate the evaluation of temporal reasoning, we introduce the Vision-Spatial-Temporal Intelligence benchmark, featuring over 138.6K QA pairs across five distinct tasks focused on evolving spatial relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model, VLM-3R, not only facilitates robust visual-spatial reasoning but also enables the understanding of temporal 3D context changes, excelling in both accuracy and scalability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Alita: Generalist Agent Enabling Scalable Agentic Reasoning with Minimal   Predefinition and Maximal Self-Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20286</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.20286.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Jiahao Qiu, Xuan Qi, Tongcheng Zhang, Xinzhe Juan, Jiacheng Guo, Yifu Lu, Yimin Wang, Zixin Yao, Qihan Ren, Xun Jiang, Xing Zhou, Dongrui Liu, Ling Yang, Yue Wu, Kaixuan Huang, Shilong Liu, Hongru Wang, Mengdi Wang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agents to autonomously perform complex, open-ended tasks. However, many existing frameworks depend heavily on manually predefined tools and workflows, which hinder their adaptability, scalability, and generalization across domains. In this work, we introduce Alita--a generalist agent designed with the principle of "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication," enabling scalable agentic reasoning through minimal predefinition and maximal self-evolution. For minimal predefinition, Alita is equipped with only one component for direct problem-solving, making it much simpler and neater than previous approaches that relied heavily on hand-crafted, elaborate tools and workflows. This clean design enhances its potential to generalize to challenging questions, without being limited by tools. For Maximal self-evolution, we enable the creativity of Alita by providing a suite of general-purpose components to autonomously construct, refine, and reuse external capabilities by generating task-related model context protocols (MCPs) from open source, which contributes to scalable agentic reasoning. Notably, Alita achieves 75.15% pass@1 and 87.27% pass@3 accuracy, which is top-ranking among general-purpose agents, on the GAIA benchmark validation dataset, 74.00% and 52.00% pass@1, respectively, on Mathvista and PathVQA, outperforming many agent systems with far greater complexity.

      <title>MotionPro: A Precise Motion Controller for Image-to-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20287</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.20287.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Zhongwei Zhang, Fuchen Long, Zhaofan Qiu, Yingwei Pan, Wu Liu, Ting Yao, Tao Mei&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Animating images with interactive motion control has garnered popularity for image-to-video (I2V) generation. Modern approaches typically rely on large Gaussian kernels to extend motion trajectories as condition without explicitly defining movement region, leading to coarse motion control and failing to disentangle object and camera moving. To alleviate these, we present MotionPro, a precise motion controller that novelly leverages region-wise trajectory and motion mask to regulate fine-grained motion synthesis and identify target motion category (i.e., object or camera moving), respectively. Technically, MotionPro first estimates the flow maps on each training video via a tracking model, and then samples the region-wise trajectories to simulate inference scenario. Instead of extending flow through large Gaussian kernels, our region-wise trajectory approach enables more precise control by directly utilizing trajectories within local regions, thereby effectively characterizing fine-grained movements. A motion mask is simultaneously derived from the predicted flow maps to capture the holistic motion dynamics of the movement regions. To pursue natural motion control, MotionPro further strengthens video denoising by incorporating both region-wise trajectories and motion mask through feature modulation. More remarkably, we meticulously construct a benchmark, i.e., MC-Bench, with 1.1K user-annotated image-trajectory pairs, for the evaluation of both fine-grained and object-level I2V motion control. Extensive experiments conducted on WebVid-10M and MC-Bench demonstrate the effectiveness of MotionPro.

      <title>VisualToolAgent (VisTA): A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Visual   Tool Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20289</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.20289.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Zeyi Huang, Yuyang Ji, Anirudh Sundara Rajan, Zefan Cai, Wen Xiao, Junjie Hu, Yong Jae Lee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce VisTA, a new reinforcement learning framework that empowers visual agents to dynamically explore, select, and combine tools from a diverse library based on empirical performance. Existing methods for tool-augmented reasoning either rely on training-free prompting or large-scale fine-tuning; both lack active tool exploration and typically assume limited tool diversity, and fine-tuning methods additionally demand extensive human supervision. In contrast, VisTA leverages end-to-end reinforcement learning to iteratively refine sophisticated, query-specific tool selection strategies, using task outcomes as feedback signals. Through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our framework enables an agent to autonomously discover effective tool-selection pathways without requiring explicit reasoning supervision. Experiments on the ChartQA, Geometry3K, and BlindTest benchmarks demonstrate that VisTA achieves substantial performance gains over training-free baselines, especially on out-of-distribution examples. These results highlight VisTA's ability to enhance generalization, adaptively utilize diverse tools, and pave the way for flexible, experience-driven visual reasoning systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>OpenS2V-Nexus: A Detailed Benchmark and Million-Scale Dataset for   Subject-to-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20292</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.20292.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Shenghai Yuan, Xianyi He, Yufan Deng, Yang Ye, Jinfa Huang, Bin Lin, Chongyang Ma, Jiebo Luo, Li Yuan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 49&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Subject-to-Video (S2V) generation aims to create videos that faithfully incorporate reference content, providing enhanced flexibility in the production of videos. To establish the infrastructure for S2V generation, we propose OpenS2V-Nexus, consisting of (i) OpenS2V-Eval, a fine-grained benchmark, and (ii) OpenS2V-5M, a million-scale dataset. In contrast to existing S2V benchmarks inherited from VBench that focus on global and coarse-grained assessment of generated videos, OpenS2V-Eval focuses on the model's ability to generate subject-consistent videos with natural subject appearance and identity fidelity. For these purposes, OpenS2V-Eval introduces 180 prompts from seven major categories of S2V, which incorporate both real and synthetic test data. Furthermore, to accurately align human preferences with S2V benchmarks, we propose three automatic metrics, NexusScore, NaturalScore and GmeScore, to separately quantify subject consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos. Building on this, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16 representative S2V models, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses across different content. Moreover, we create the first open-source large-scale S2V generation dataset OpenS2V-5M, which consists of five million high-quality 720P subject-text-video triples. Specifically, we ensure subject-information diversity in our dataset by (1) segmenting subjects and building pairing information via cross-video associations and (2) prompting GPT-Image-1 on raw frames to synthesize multi-view representations. Through OpenS2V-Nexus, we deliver a robust infrastructure to accelerate future S2V generation research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MMPerspective: Do MLLMs Understand Perspective? A Comprehensive   Benchmark for Perspective Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20426</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.20426.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yunlong Tang, Pinxin Liu, Mingqian Feng, Zhangyun Tan, Rui Mao, Chao Huang, Jing Bi, Yunzhong Xiao, Susan Liang, Hang Hua, Ali Vosoughi, Luchuan Song, Zeliang Zhang, Chenliang Xu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Understanding perspective is fundamental to human visual perception, yet the extent to which multimodal large language models (MLLMs) internalize perspective geometry remains unclear. We introduce MMPerspective, the first benchmark specifically designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs' understanding of perspective through 10 carefully crafted tasks across three complementary dimensions: Perspective Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness. Our benchmark comprises 2,711 real-world and synthetic image instances with 5,083 question-answer pairs that probe key capabilities, such as vanishing point perception and counting, perspective type reasoning, line relationship understanding in 3D space, invariance to perspective-preserving transformations, etc. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 43 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations: while models demonstrate competence on surface-level perceptual tasks, they struggle with compositional reasoning and maintaining spatial consistency under perturbations. Our analysis further reveals intriguing patterns between model architecture, scale, and perspective capabilities, highlighting both robustness bottlenecks and the benefits of chain-of-thought prompting. MMPerspective establishes a valuable testbed for diagnosing and advancing spatial understanding in vision-language systems.

      <title>Beyond Markovian: Reflective Exploration via Bayes-Adaptive RL for LLM   Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20561</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.20561.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Shenao Zhang, Yaqing Wang, Yinxiao Liu, Tianqi Liu, Peter Grabowski, Eugene Ie, Zhaoran Wang, Yunxuan Li&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Large Language Models (LLMs) trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) have exhibited strong reasoning capabilities and emergent reflective behaviors, such as backtracking and error correction. However, conventional Markovian RL confines exploration to the training phase to learn an optimal deterministic policy and depends on the history contexts only through the current state. Therefore, it remains unclear whether reflective reasoning will emerge during Markovian RL training, or why they are beneficial at test time. To remedy this, we recast reflective exploration within the Bayes-Adaptive RL framework, which explicitly optimizes the expected return under a posterior distribution over Markov decision processes. This Bayesian formulation inherently incentivizes both reward-maximizing exploitation and information-gathering exploration via belief updates. Our resulting algorithm, BARL, instructs the LLM to stitch and switch strategies based on the observed outcomes, offering principled guidance on when and how the model should reflectively explore. Empirical results on both synthetic and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that BARL outperforms standard Markovian RL approaches at test time, achieving superior token efficiency with improved exploration effectiveness. Our code is available at https://github.com/shenao-zhang/BARL.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>FinTagging: An LLM-ready Benchmark for Extracting and Structuring   Financial Information</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.20650.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yan Wang, Yang Ren, Lingfei Qian, Xueqing Peng, Keyi Wang, Yi Han, Dongji Feng, Xiao-Yang Liu, Jimin Huang, Qianqian Xie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce FinTagging, the first full-scope, table-aware XBRL benchmark designed to evaluate the structured information extraction and semantic alignment capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in the context of XBRL-based financial reporting. Unlike prior benchmarks that oversimplify XBRL tagging as flat multi-class classification and focus solely on narrative text, FinTagging decomposes the XBRL tagging problem into two subtasks: FinNI for financial entity extraction and FinCL for taxonomy-driven concept alignment. It requires models to jointly extract facts and align them with the full 10k+ US-GAAP taxonomy across both unstructured text and structured tables, enabling realistic, fine-grained evaluation. We assess a diverse set of LLMs under zero-shot settings, systematically analyzing their performance on both subtasks and overall tagging accuracy. Our results reveal that, while LLMs demonstrate strong generalization in information extraction, they struggle with fine-grained concept alignment, particularly in disambiguating closely related taxonomy entries. These findings highlight the limitations of existing LLMs in fully automating XBRL tagging and underscore the need for improved semantic reasoning and schema-aware modeling to meet the demands of accurate financial disclosure. Code is available at our GitHub repository and data is at our Hugging Face repository.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rendering-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Vector Graphics Generation</title>

Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled high-quality SVG generation by framing the problem as a code generation task and leveraging large-scale pretraining. VLMs are particularly suitable for this task as they capture both global semantics and fine-grained visual patterns, while transferring knowledge across vision, natural language, and code domains. However, existing VLM approaches often struggle to produce faithful and efficient SVGs because they never observe the rendered images during training. Although differentiable rendering for autoregressive SVG code generation remains unavailable, rendered outputs can still be compared to original inputs, enabling evaluative feedback suitable for reinforcement learning (RL). We introduce RLRF(Reinforcement Learning from Rendering Feedback), an RL method that enhances SVG generation in autoregressive VLMs by leveraging feedback from rendered SVG outputs. Given an input image, the model generates SVG roll-outs that are rendered and compared to the original image to compute a reward. This visual fidelity feedback guides the model toward producing more accurate, efficient, and semantically coherent SVGs. RLRF significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning, addressing common failure modes and enabling precise, high-quality SVG generation with strong structural understanding and generalization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Inverse Virtual Try-On: Generating Multi-Category Product-Style Images   from Clothed Individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21062</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.21062.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Davide Lobba, Fulvio Sanguigni, Bin Ren, Marcella Cornia, Rita Cucchiara, Nicu Sebe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; While virtual try-on (VTON) systems aim to render a garment onto a target person image, this paper tackles the novel task of virtual try-off (VTOFF), which addresses the inverse problem: generating standardized product images of garments from real-world photos of clothed individuals. Unlike VTON, which must resolve diverse pose and style variations, VTOFF benefits from a consistent and well-defined output format -- typically a flat, lay-down-style representation of the garment -- making it a promising tool for data generation and dataset enhancement. However, existing VTOFF approaches face two major limitations: (i) difficulty in disentangling garment features from occlusions and complex poses, often leading to visual artifacts, and (ii) restricted applicability to single-category garments (e.g., upper-body clothes only), limiting generalization. To address these challenges, we present Text-Enhanced MUlti-category Virtual Try-Off (TEMU-VTOFF), a novel architecture featuring a dual DiT-based backbone with a modified multimodal attention mechanism for robust garment feature extraction. Our architecture is designed to receive garment information from multiple modalities like images, text, and masks to work in a multi-category setting. Finally, we propose an additional alignment module to further refine the generated visual details. Experiments on VITON-HD and Dress Code datasets show that TEMU-VTOFF sets a new state-of-the-art on the VTOFF task, significantly improving both visual quality and fidelity to the target garments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Minute-Long Videos with Dual Parallelisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21070</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.21070.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Zeqing Wang, Bowen Zheng, Xingyi Yang, Yuecong Xu, Xinchao Wang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based video diffusion models generate high-quality videos at scale but incur prohibitive processing latency and memory costs for long videos. To address this, we propose a novel distributed inference strategy, termed DualParal. The core idea is that, instead of generating an entire video on a single GPU, we parallelize both temporal frames and model layers across GPUs. However, a naive implementation of this division faces a key limitation: since diffusion models require synchronized noise levels across frames, this implementation leads to the serialization of original parallelisms. We leverage a block-wise denoising scheme to handle this. Namely, we process a sequence of frame blocks through the pipeline with progressively decreasing noise levels. Each GPU handles a specific block and layer subset while passing previous results to the next GPU, enabling asynchronous computation and communication. To further optimize performance, we incorporate two key enhancements. Firstly, a feature cache is implemented on each GPU to store and reuse features from the prior block as context, minimizing inter-GPU communication and redundant computation. Secondly, we employ a coordinated noise initialization strategy, ensuring globally consistent temporal dynamics by sharing initial noise patterns across GPUs without extra resource costs. Together, these enable fast, artifact-free, and infinitely long video generation. Applied to the latest diffusion transformer video generator, our method efficiently produces 1,025-frame videos with up to 6.54times lower latency and 1.48times lower memory cost on 8timesRTX 4090 GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Thinker: Learning to Think Fast and Slow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21097</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.21097.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Stephen Chung, Wenyu Du, Jie Fu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Recent studies show that the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be improved by applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to question-answering (QA) tasks in areas such as math and coding. With a long context length, LLMs may learn to perform search, as indicated by the self-correction behavior observed in DeepSeek R1. However, this search behavior is often imprecise and lacks confidence, resulting in long, redundant responses and highlighting deficiencies in intuition and verification. Inspired by the Dual Process Theory in psychology, we introduce a simple modification to the QA task that includes four stages: Fast Thinking, where the LLM must answer within a strict token budget; Verification, where the model evaluates its initial response; Slow Thinking, where it refines the initial response with more deliberation; and Summarization, where it distills the refinement from the previous stage into precise steps. Our proposed task improves average accuracy from 24.9% to 27.9% for Qwen2.5-1.5B, and from 45.9% to 49.8% for DeepSeek-R1-Qwen-1.5B. Notably, for Qwen2.5-1.5B, the Fast Thinking mode alone achieves 26.8% accuracy using fewer than 1000 tokens, demonstrating substantial inference efficiency gains. These findings suggest that intuition and deliberative reasoning are distinct, complementary systems benefiting from targeted training.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Walk Before You Run! Concise LLM Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21178</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.21178.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Mingyang Song, Mao Zheng&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; As test-time scaling becomes a pivotal research frontier in Large Language Models (LLMs) development, contemporary and advanced post-training methodologies increasingly focus on extending the generation length of long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) responses to enhance reasoning capabilities toward DeepSeek R1-like performance. However, recent studies reveal a persistent overthinking phenomenon in state-of-the-art reasoning models, manifesting as excessive redundancy or repetitive thinking patterns in long CoT responses. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective two-stage reinforcement learning framework for achieving concise reasoning in LLMs, named ConciseR. Specifically, the first stage, using more training steps, aims to incentivize the model's reasoning capabilities via Group Relative Policy Optimization with clip-higher and dynamic sampling components (GRPO++), and the second stage, using fewer training steps, explicitly enforces conciseness and improves efficiency via Length-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (L-GRPO). Significantly, ConciseR only optimizes response length once all rollouts of a sample are correct, following the "walk before you run" principle. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our ConciseR model, which generates more concise CoT reasoning responses, outperforms recent state-of-the-art reasoning models with zero RL paradigm across AIME 2024, MATH-500, AMC 2023, Minerva, and Olympiad benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Exploring the Latent Capacity of LLMs for One-Step Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21189</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.21189.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Gleb Mezentsev, Ivan Oseledets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 39&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; A recent study showed that large language models (LLMs) can reconstruct surprisingly long texts - up to thousands of tokens - via autoregressive generation from just one specially trained input embedding. In this work, we explore whether such reconstruction is possible without autoregression. We show that frozen LLMs can generate hundreds of accurate tokens in just one forward pass, when provided with only two learned embeddings. This reveals a surprising and underexplored capability of LLMs - multi-token generation without iterative decoding. We investigate the behaviour of these embeddings and provide insight into the type of information they encode. We also empirically show that although these representations are not unique for a given text, they form connected and local regions in embedding space - a property that suggests the potential of learning a dedicated encoder into that space.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sci-Fi: Symmetric Constraint for Frame Inbetweening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21205</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.21205.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Liuhan Chen, Xiaodong Cun, Xiaoyu Li, Xianyi He, Shenghai Yuan, Jie Chen, Ying Shan, Li Yuan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Frame inbetweening aims to synthesize intermediate video sequences conditioned on the given start and end frames. Current state-of-the-art methods mainly extend large-scale pre-trained Image-to-Video Diffusion models (I2V-DMs) by incorporating end-frame constraints via directly fine-tuning or omitting training. We identify a critical limitation in their design: Their injections of the end-frame constraint usually utilize the same mechanism that originally imposed the start-frame (single image) constraint. However, since the original I2V-DMs are adequately trained for the start-frame condition in advance, naively introducing the end-frame constraint by the same mechanism with much less (even zero) specialized training probably can't make the end frame have a strong enough impact on the intermediate content like the start frame. This asymmetric control strength of the two frames over the intermediate content likely leads to inconsistent motion or appearance collapse in generated frames. To efficiently achieve symmetric constraints of start and end frames, we propose a novel framework, termed Sci-Fi, which applies a stronger injection for the constraint of a smaller training scale. Specifically, it deals with the start-frame constraint as before, while introducing the end-frame constraint by an improved mechanism. The new mechanism is based on a well-designed lightweight module, named EF-Net, which encodes only the end frame and expands it into temporally adaptive frame-wise features injected into the I2V-DM. This makes the end-frame constraint as strong as the start-frame constraint, enabling our Sci-Fi to produce more harmonious transitions in various scenarios. Extensive experiments prove the superiority of our Sci-Fi compared with other baselines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>rStar-Coder: Scaling Competitive Code Reasoning with a Large-Scale   Verified Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21297</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.21297.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yifei Liu, Li Lyna Zhang, Yi Zhu, Bingcheng Dong, Xudong Zhou, Ning Shang, Fan Yang, Mao Yang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 22&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Advancing code reasoning in large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally limited by the scarcity of high-difficulty datasets, especially those with verifiable input-output test cases necessary for rigorous solution validation at scale. We introduce rStar-Coder, which significantly improves LLM code reasoning capabilities by constructing a large-scale, verified dataset of 418K competition-level code problems, 580K long-reasoning solutions along with rich test cases of varying difficulty. This is achieved through three core contributions: (1) we curate competitive programming code problems and oracle solutions to synthesize new, solvable problems; (2) we introduce a reliable input-output test case synthesis pipeline that decouples the generation into a three-step input generation method and a mutual verification mechanism for effective output labeling; (3) we augment problems with high-quality, test-case-verified long-reasoning solutions. Extensive experiments on Qwen models (1.5B-14B) across various code reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of rStar-Coder dataset, achieving leading performance comparable to frontier reasoning LLMs with much smaller model sizes. On LiveCodeBench, rStar-Coder improves Qwen2.5-7B from 17.4% to an impressive 57.3%, and Qwen2.5-14B from 23.3% to 62.5%, surpassing o3-mini (low) by3.1%. On the more challenging USA Computing Olympiad, our 7B model achieves an average pass@1 accuracy of 16.15%, outperforming the frontier-level QWQ-32B. Code and the dataset will be released at https://github.com/microsoft/rStar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MME-Reasoning: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Logical Reasoning in MLLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21327</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.21327.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Jiakang Yuan, Tianshuo Peng, Yilei Jiang, Yiting Lu, Renrui Zhang, Kaituo Feng, Chaoyou Fu, Tao Chen, Lei Bai, Bo Zhang, Xiangyu Yue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 72&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Logical reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence and an essential capability for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Despite the significant advancement in multimodal reasoning, existing benchmarks fail to comprehensively evaluate their reasoning abilities due to the lack of explicit categorization for logical reasoning types and an unclear understanding of reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce MME-Reasoning, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of MLLMs, which covers all three types of reasoning (i.e., inductive, deductive, and abductive) in its questions. We carefully curate the data to ensure that each question effectively evaluates reasoning ability rather than perceptual skills or knowledge breadth, and extend the evaluation protocols to cover the evaluation of diverse questions. Our evaluation reveals substantial limitations of state-of-the-art MLLMs when subjected to holistic assessments of logical reasoning capabilities. Even the most advanced MLLMs show limited performance in comprehensive logical reasoning, with notable performance imbalances across reasoning types. In addition, we conducted an in-depth analysis of approaches such as ``thinking mode'' and Rule-based RL, which are commonly believed to enhance reasoning abilities. These findings highlight the critical limitations and performance imbalances of current MLLMs in diverse logical reasoning scenarios, providing comprehensive and systematic insights into the understanding and evaluation of reasoning capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MME-VideoOCR: Evaluating OCR-Based Capabilities of Multimodal LLMs in   Video Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21333</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.21333.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yang Shi, Huanqian Wang, Wulin Xie, Huanyao Zhang, Lijie Zhao, Yi-Fan Zhang, Xinfeng Li, Chaoyou Fu, Zhuoer Wen, Wenting Liu, Zhuoran Zhang, Xinlong Chen, Bohan Zeng, Sihan Yang, Yuanxing Zhang, Pengfei Wan, Haotian Wang, Wenjing Yang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 30&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved considerable accuracy in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) from static images. However, their efficacy in video OCR is significantly diminished due to factors such as motion blur, temporal variations, and visual effects inherent in video content. To provide clearer guidance for training practical MLLMs, we introduce the MME-VideoOCR benchmark, which encompasses a comprehensive range of video OCR application scenarios. MME-VideoOCR features 10 task categories comprising 25 individual tasks and spans 44 diverse scenarios. These tasks extend beyond text recognition to incorporate deeper comprehension and reasoning of textual content within videos. The benchmark consists of 1,464 videos with varying resolutions, aspect ratios, and durations, along with 2,000 meticulously curated, manually annotated question-answer pairs. We evaluate 18 state-of-the-art MLLMs on MME-VideoOCR, revealing that even the best-performing model (Gemini-2.5 Pro) achieves an accuracy of only 73.7%. Fine-grained analysis indicates that while existing MLLMs demonstrate strong performance on tasks where relevant texts are contained within a single or few frames, they exhibit limited capability in effectively handling tasks that demand holistic video comprehension. These limitations are especially evident in scenarios that require spatio-temporal reasoning, cross-frame information integration, or resistance to language prior bias. Our findings also highlight the importance of high-resolution visual input and sufficient temporal coverage for reliable OCR in dynamic video scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>HoliTom: Holistic Token Merging for Fast Video Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21334</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.21334.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Kele Shao, Keda Tao, Can Qin, Haoxuan You, Yang Sui, Huan Wang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 17&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Video large language models (video LLMs) excel at video comprehension but face significant computational inefficiency due to redundant video tokens. Existing token pruning methods offer solutions. However, approaches operating within the LLM (inner-LLM pruning), such as FastV, incur intrinsic computational overhead in shallow layers. In contrast, methods performing token pruning before the LLM (outer-LLM pruning) primarily address spatial redundancy within individual frames or limited temporal windows, neglecting the crucial global temporal dynamics and correlations across longer video sequences. This leads to sub-optimal spatio-temporal reduction and does not leverage video compressibility fully. Crucially, the synergistic potential and mutual influence of combining these strategies remain unexplored. To further reduce redundancy, we introduce HoliTom, a novel training-free holistic token merging framework. HoliTom employs outer-LLM pruning through global redundancy-aware temporal segmentation, followed by spatial-temporal merging to reduce visual tokens by over 90%, significantly alleviating the LLM's computational burden. Complementing this, we introduce a robust inner-LLM token similarity-based merging approach, designed for superior performance and compatibility with outer-LLM pruning. Evaluations demonstrate our method's promising efficiency-performance trade-off on LLaVA-OneVision-7B, reducing computational costs to 6.9% of FLOPs while maintaining 99.1% of the original performance. Furthermore, we achieve a 2.28x reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and a 1.32x acceleration in decoding throughput, highlighting the practical benefits of our integrated pruning approach for efficient video LLMs inference.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Video-Holmes: Can MLLM Think Like Holmes for Complex Video Reasoning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21374</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.21374.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Junhao Cheng, Yuying Ge, Teng Wang, Yixiao Ge, Jing Liao, Ying Shan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 26&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Recent advances in CoT reasoning and RL post-training have been reported to enhance video reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. This progress naturally raises a question: can these models perform complex video reasoning in a manner comparable to human experts? However, existing video benchmarks primarily evaluate visual perception and grounding abilities, with questions that can be answered based on explicit prompts or isolated visual cues. Such benchmarks do not fully capture the intricacies of real-world reasoning, where humans must actively search for, integrate, and analyze multiple clues before reaching a conclusion. To address this issue, we present Video-Holmes, a benchmark inspired by the reasoning process of Sherlock Holmes, designed to evaluate the complex video reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Video-Holmes consists of 1,837 questions derived from 270 manually annotated suspense short films, which spans seven carefully designed tasks. Each task is constructed by first identifying key events and causal relationships within films, and then designing questions that require models to actively locate and connect multiple relevant visual clues scattered across different video segments. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals that, while these models generally excel at visual perception, they encounter substantial difficulties with integrating information and often miss critical clues. For example, the best-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves an accuracy of only 45%, with most models scoring below 40%. We aim that Video-Holmes can serve as a "Holmes-test" for multimodal reasoning, motivating models to reason more like humans and emphasizing the ongoing challenges in this field. The benchmark is released in https://github.com/TencentARC/Video-Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Active-O3: Empowering Multimodal Large Language Models with Active   Perception via GRPO</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.21457.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Muzhi Zhu, Hao Zhong, Canyu Zhao, Zongze Du, Zheng Huang, Mingyu Liu, Hao Chen, Cheng Zou, Jingdong Chen, Ming Yang, Chunhua Shen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 11&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Active vision, also known as active perception, refers to the process of actively selecting where and how to look in order to gather task-relevant information. It is a critical component of efficient perception and decision-making in humans and advanced embodied agents. Recently, the use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as central planning and decision-making modules in robotic systems has gained extensive attention. However, despite the importance of active perception in embodied intelligence, there is little to no exploration of how MLLMs can be equipped with or learn active perception capabilities. In this paper, we first provide a systematic definition of MLLM-based active perception tasks. We point out that the recently proposed GPT-o3 model's zoom-in search strategy can be regarded as a special case of active perception; however, it still suffers from low search efficiency and inaccurate region selection. To address these issues, we propose ACTIVE-O3, a purely reinforcement learning based training framework built on top of GRPO, designed to equip MLLMs with active perception capabilities. We further establish a comprehensive benchmark suite to evaluate ACTIVE-O3 across both general open-world tasks, such as small-object and dense object grounding, and domain-specific scenarios, including small object detection in remote sensing and autonomous driving, as well as fine-grained interactive segmentation. In addition, ACTIVE-O3 also demonstrates strong zero-shot reasoning abilities on the V* Benchmark, without relying on any explicit reasoning data. We hope that our work can provide a simple codebase and evaluation protocol to facilitate future research on active perception in MLLMs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, the limited context window of LLMs obstructs scaling the amount of external knowledge input, prohibiting further improvement, especially for tasks requiring significant amount of external knowledge. Existing context window extension methods inevitably cause information loss. LLM-based multi-agent methods emerge as a new paradigm to handle massive input in a distributional manner, where we identify two core bottlenecks in existing knowledge synchronization and reasoning processes. In this work, we develop a multi-agent framework, ExtAgents, to overcome the bottlenecks and enable better scalability in inference-time knowledge integration without longer-context training. Benchmarked with our enhanced multi-hop question answering test, $boldsymbol{inftyBench+}, and other public test sets including long survey generation, ExtAgents significantly enhances the performance over existing non-training methods with the same amount of external knowledge input, regardless of whether it falls within or exceeds the context window$. Moreover, the method maintains high efficiency due to high parallelism. Further study in the coordination of LLM agents on increasing external knowledge input could benefit real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>DetailFlow: 1D Coarse-to-Fine Autoregressive Image Generation via   Next-Detail Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21473</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.21473.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yiheng Liu, Liao Qu, Huichao Zhang, Xu Wang, Yi Jiang, Yiming Gao, Hu Ye, Xian Li, Shuai Wang, Daniel K. Du, Shu Cheng, Zehuan Yuan, Xinglong Wu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; This paper presents DetailFlow, a coarse-to-fine 1D autoregressive (AR) image generation method that models images through a novel next-detail prediction strategy. By learning a resolution-aware token sequence supervised with progressively degraded images, DetailFlow enables the generation process to start from the global structure and incrementally refine details. This coarse-to-fine 1D token sequence aligns well with the autoregressive inference mechanism, providing a more natural and efficient way for the AR model to generate complex visual content. Our compact 1D AR model achieves high-quality image synthesis with significantly fewer tokens than previous approaches, i.e. VAR/VQGAN. We further propose a parallel inference mechanism with self-correction that accelerates generation speed by approximately 8x while reducing accumulation sampling error inherent in teacher-forcing supervision. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, our method achieves 2.96 gFID with 128 tokens, outperforming VAR (3.3 FID) and FlexVAR (3.05 FID), which both require 680 tokens in their AR models. Moreover, due to the significantly reduced token count and parallel inference mechanism, our method runs nearly 2x faster inference speed compared to VAR and FlexVAR. Extensive experimental results demonstrate DetailFlow's superior generation quality and efficiency compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Frame In-N-Out: Unbounded Controllable Image-to-Video Generation</title>

In this paper, we focus on a commonly used yet underexplored cinematic technique known as Frame In and Frame Out. Specifically, starting from image-to-video generation, users can control the objects in the image to naturally leave the scene or provide breaking new identity references to enter the scene, guided by user-specified motion trajectory. To support this task, we introduce a new dataset curated semi-automatically, a comprehensive evaluation protocol targeting this setting, and an efficient identity-preserving motion-controllable video Diffusion Transformer architecture. Our evaluation shows that our proposed approach significantly outperforms existing baselines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reinforcing General Reasoning without Verifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21493</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.21493.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Xiangxin Zhou, Zichen Liu, Anya Sims, Haonan Wang, Tianyu Pang, Chongxuan Li, Liang Wang, Min Lin, Chao Du&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 12&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; The recent paradigm shift towards training large language models (LLMs) using DeepSeek-R1-Zero-style reinforcement learning (RL) on verifiable rewards has led to impressive advancements in code and mathematical reasoning. However, this methodology is limited to tasks where rule-based answer verification is possible and does not naturally extend to real-world domains such as chemistry, healthcare, engineering, law, biology, business, and economics. Current practical workarounds use an additional LLM as a model-based verifier; however, this introduces issues such as reliance on a strong verifier LLM, susceptibility to reward hacking, and the practical burden of maintaining the verifier model in memory during training. To address this and extend DeepSeek-R1-Zero-style training to general reasoning domains, we propose a verifier-free method (VeriFree) that bypasses answer verification and instead uses RL to directly maximize the probability of generating the reference answer. We compare VeriFree with verifier-based methods and demonstrate that, in addition to its significant practical benefits and reduced compute requirements, VeriFree matches and even surpasses verifier-based methods on extensive evaluations across MMLU-Pro, GPQA, SuperGPQA, and math-related benchmarks. Moreover, we provide insights into this method from multiple perspectives: as an elegant integration of training both the policy and implicit verifier in a unified model, and as a variational optimization approach.

      <title>Adversarial Attacks against Closed-Source MLLMs via Feature Optimal   Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21494</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.21494.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Xiaojun Jia, Sensen Gao, Simeng Qin, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Yihao Huang, Xinfeng Li, Yiming Li, Bo Li, Yang Liu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain vulnerable to transferable adversarial examples. While existing methods typically achieve targeted attacks by aligning global features-such as CLIP's [CLS] token-between adversarial and target samples, they often overlook the rich local information encoded in patch tokens. This leads to suboptimal alignment and limited transferability, particularly for closed-source models. To address this limitation, we propose a targeted transferable adversarial attack method based on feature optimal alignment, called FOA-Attack, to improve adversarial transfer capability. Specifically, at the global level, we introduce a global feature loss based on cosine similarity to align the coarse-grained features of adversarial samples with those of target samples. At the local level, given the rich local representations within Transformers, we leverage clustering techniques to extract compact local patterns to alleviate redundant local features. We then formulate local feature alignment between adversarial and target samples as an optimal transport (OT) problem and propose a local clustering optimal transport loss to refine fine-grained feature alignment. Additionally, we propose a dynamic ensemble model weighting strategy to adaptively balance the influence of multiple models during adversarial example generation, thereby further improving transferability. Extensive experiments across various models demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, especially in transferring to closed-source MLLMs. The code is released at https://github.com/jiaxiaojunQAQ/FOA-Attack.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>UI-Genie: A Self-Improving Approach for Iteratively Boosting MLLM-based   Mobile GUI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21496</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.21496.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Han Xiao, Guozhi Wang, Yuxiang Chai, Zimu Lu, Weifeng Lin, Hao He, Lue Fan, Liuyang Bian, Rui Hu, Liang Liu, Shuai Ren, Yafei Wen, Xiaoxin Chen, Aojun Zhou, Hongsheng Li&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 33&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; In this paper, we introduce UI-Genie, a self-improving framework addressing two key challenges in GUI agents: verification of trajectory outcome is challenging and high-quality training data are not scalable. These challenges are addressed by a reward model and a self-improving pipeline, respectively. The reward model, UI-Genie-RM, features an image-text interleaved architecture that efficiently pro- cesses historical context and unifies action-level and task-level rewards. To sup- port the training of UI-Genie-RM, we develop deliberately-designed data genera- tion strategies including rule-based verification, controlled trajectory corruption, and hard negative mining. To address the second challenge, a self-improvement pipeline progressively expands solvable complex GUI tasks by enhancing both the agent and reward models through reward-guided exploration and outcome verification in dynamic environments. For training the model, we generate UI- Genie-RM-517k and UI-Genie-Agent-16k, establishing the first reward-specific dataset for GUI agents while demonstrating high-quality synthetic trajectory gen- eration without manual annotation. Experimental results show that UI-Genie achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple GUI agent benchmarks with three generations of data-model self-improvement. We open-source our complete framework implementation and generated datasets to facilitate further research in https://github.com/Euphoria16/UI-Genie.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Paper2Poster: Towards Multimodal Poster Automation from Scientific   Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21497</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.21497.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Wei Pang, Kevin Qinghong Lin, Xiangru Jian, Xi He, Philip Torr&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 66&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Academic poster generation is a crucial yet challenging task in scientific communication, requiring the compression of long-context interleaved documents into a single, visually coherent page. To address this challenge, we introduce the first benchmark and metric suite for poster generation, which pairs recent conference papers with author-designed posters and evaluates outputs on (i)Visual Quality-semantic alignment with human posters, (ii)Textual Coherence-language fluency, (iii)Holistic Assessment-six fine-grained aesthetic and informational criteria scored by a VLM-as-judge, and notably (iv)PaperQuiz-the poster's ability to convey core paper content as measured by VLMs answering generated quizzes. Building on this benchmark, we propose PosterAgent, a top-down, visual-in-the-loop multi-agent pipeline: the (a)Parser distills the paper into a structured asset library; the (b)Planner aligns text-visual pairs into a binary-tree layout that preserves reading order and spatial balance; and the (c)Painter-Commenter loop refines each panel by executing rendering code and using VLM feedback to eliminate overflow and ensure alignment. In our comprehensive evaluation, we find that GPT-4o outputs-though visually appealing at first glance-often exhibit noisy text and poor PaperQuiz scores, and we find that reader engagement is the primary aesthetic bottleneck, as human-designed posters rely largely on visual semantics to convey meaning. Our fully open-source variants (e.g. based on the Qwen-2.5 series) outperform existing 4o-driven multi-agent systems across nearly all metrics, while using 87% fewer tokens. It transforms a 22-page paper into a finalized yet editable .pptx poster - all for just $0.005. These findings chart clear directions for the next generation of fully automated poster-generation models.

      <title>AdInject: Real-World Black-Box Attacks on Web Agents via Advertising   Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21499</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.21499.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Haowei Wang, Junjie Wang, Xiaojun Jia, Rupeng Zhang, Mingyang Li, Zhe Liu, Yang Liu, Qing Wang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Vision-Language Model (VLM) based Web Agents represent a significant step towards automating complex tasks by simulating human-like interaction with websites. However, their deployment in uncontrolled web environments introduces significant security vulnerabilities. Existing research on adversarial environmental injection attacks often relies on unrealistic assumptions, such as direct HTML manipulation, knowledge of user intent, or access to agent model parameters, limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose AdInject, a novel and real-world black-box attack method that leverages the internet advertising delivery to inject malicious content into the Web Agent's environment. AdInject operates under a significantly more realistic threat model than prior work, assuming a black-box agent, static malicious content constraints, and no specific knowledge of user intent. AdInject includes strategies for designing malicious ad content aimed at misleading agents into clicking, and a VLM-based ad content optimization technique that infers potential user intents from the target website's context and integrates these intents into the ad content to make it appear more relevant or critical to the agent's task, thus enhancing attack effectiveness. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of AdInject, attack success rates exceeding 60% in most scenarios and approaching 100% in certain cases. This strongly demonstrates that prevalent advertising delivery constitutes a potent and real-world vector for environment injection attacks against Web Agents. This work highlights a critical vulnerability in Web Agent security arising from real-world environment manipulation channels, underscoring the urgent need for developing robust defense mechanisms against such threats.

      <title>ViewSpatial-Bench: Evaluating Multi-perspective Spatial Localization in   Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.21500.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Dingming Li, Hongxing Li, Zixuan Wang, Yuchen Yan, Hang Zhang, Siqi Chen, Guiyang Hou, Shengpei Jiang, Wenqi Zhang, Yongliang Shen, Weiming Lu, Yueting Zhuang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and reasoning about visual content, but significant challenges persist in tasks requiring cross-viewpoint understanding and spatial reasoning. We identify a critical limitation: current VLMs excel primarily at egocentric spatial reasoning (from the camera's perspective) but fail to generalize to allocentric viewpoints when required to adopt another entity's spatial frame of reference. We introduce ViewSpatial-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for multi-viewpoint spatial localization recognition evaluation across five distinct task types, supported by an automated 3D annotation pipeline that generates precise directional labels. Comprehensive evaluation of diverse VLMs on ViewSpatial-Bench reveals a significant performance disparity: models demonstrate reasonable performance on camera-perspective tasks but exhibit reduced accuracy when reasoning from a human viewpoint. By fine-tuning VLMs on our multi-perspective spatial dataset, we achieve an overall performance improvement of 46.24% across tasks, highlighting the efficacy of our approach. Our work establishes a crucial benchmark for spatial intelligence in embodied AI systems and provides empirical evidence that modeling 3D spatial relationships enhances VLMs' corresponding spatial comprehension capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Vision Transformers with Self-Distilled Registers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21501</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.21501.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yinjie Chen, Zipeng Yan, Chong Zhou, Bo Dai, Andrew F. Luo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for visual processing tasks, demonstrating excellent scalability with increased training data and model size. However, recent work has identified the emergence of artifact tokens in ViTs that are incongruous with the local semantics. These anomalous tokens degrade ViT performance in tasks that require fine-grained localization or structural coherence. An effective mitigation of this issue is to the addition of register tokens to ViTs, which implicitly "absorb" the artifact term during training. Given the availability of various large-scale pre-trained ViTs, in this paper we aim at equipping them with such register tokens without the need of re-training them from scratch, which is infeasible considering their size. Specifically, we propose Post Hoc Registers (PH-Reg), an efficient self-distillation method that integrates registers into an existing ViT without requiring additional labeled data and full retraining. PH-Reg initializes both teacher and student networks from the same pre-trained ViT. The teacher remains frozen and unmodified, while the student is augmented with randomly initialized register tokens. By applying test-time augmentation to the teacher's inputs, we generate denoised dense embeddings free of artifacts, which are then used to optimize only a small subset of unlocked student weights. We show that our approach can effectively reduce the number of artifact tokens, improving the segmentation and depth prediction of the student ViT under zero-shot and linear probing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How does Alignment Enhance LLMs' Multilingual Capabilities? A Language   Neurons Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21505</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2505.21505.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Shimao Zhang, Zhejian Lai, Xiang Liu, Shuaijie She, Xiao Liu, Yeyun Gong, Shujian Huang, Jiajun Chen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 15&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Multilingual Alignment is an effective and representative paradigm to enhance LLMs' multilingual capabilities, which transfers the capabilities from the high-resource languages to the low-resource languages. Meanwhile, some researches on language-specific neurons reveal that there are language-specific neurons that are selectively activated in LLMs when processing different languages. This provides a new perspective to analyze and understand LLMs' mechanisms more specifically in multilingual scenarios. In this work, we propose a new finer-grained neuron identification algorithm, which detects language neurons~(including language-specific neurons and language-related neurons) and language-agnostic neurons. Furthermore, based on the distributional characteristics of different types of neurons, we divide the LLMs' internal process for multilingual inference into four parts: (1) multilingual understanding, (2) shared semantic space reasoning, (3) multilingual output space transformation, and (4) vocabulary space outputting. Additionally, we systematically analyze the models before and after alignment with a focus on different types of neurons. We also analyze the phenomenon of ''Spontaneous Multilingual Alignment''. Overall, our work conducts a comprehensive investigation based on different types of neurons, providing empirical results and valuable insights for better understanding multilingual alignment and multilingual capabilities of LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
