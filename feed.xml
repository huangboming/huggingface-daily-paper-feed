      <title>StrandDesigner: Towards Practical Strand Generation with Sketch Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01650</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2508.01650.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Na Zhang, Moran Li, Chengming Xu, Han Feng, Xiaobin Hu, Jiangning Zhang, Weijian Cao, Chengjie Wang, Yanwei Fu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Realistic hair strand generation is crucial for applications like computer graphics and virtual reality. While diffusion models can generate hairstyles from text or images, these inputs lack precision and user-friendliness. Instead, we propose the first sketch-based strand generation model, which offers finer control while remaining user-friendly. Our framework tackles key challenges, such as modeling complex strand interactions and diverse sketch patterns, through two main innovations: a learnable strand upsampling strategy that encodes 3D strands into multi-scale latent spaces, and a multi-scale adaptive conditioning mechanism using a transformer with diffusion heads to ensure consistency across granularity levels. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show our method outperforms existing approaches in realism and precision. Qualitative results further confirm its effectiveness. Code will be released at [GitHub](https://github.com/fighting-Zhang/StrandDesigner).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02038</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2508.02038.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Fengping Tian, Chenyang Lyu, Xuanfan Ni, Haoqin Sun, Qingjuan Li, Zhiqiang Qian, Haijun Li, Longyue Wang, Zhao Xu, Weihua Luo, Kaifu Zhang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; This paper presents a multifunctional speech synthesis system that integrates voice cloning and emotion control speech synthesis within a unified framework. The goal of this work is to address longstanding challenges in achieving highly expressive, controllable, and natural speech generation that faithfully preserves speaker identity across diverse linguistic and emotional contexts. Our approach introduces an effective speaker-emotion disentanglement mechanism with in-batch contrastive learning, enabling independent manipulation of speaker identity and eemotional style, as well as rotational emotional embedding integration method for smooth emotion control. To support comprehensive training and evaluation, we construct CSEMOTIONS, a high-quality emotional speech dataset containing 10 hours of Mandarin speech from six professional speakers across seven emotional categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system, Marco-Voice, achieves substantial improvements in both objective and subjective metrics. Comprehensive evaluations and analysis were conducted, results show that MarcoVoice delivers competitive performance in terms of speech clarity and emotional richness, representing a substantial advance in the field of expressive neural speech synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Don't Overthink It: A Survey of Efficient R1-style Large Reasoning   Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02120</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2508.02120.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Linan Yue, Yichao Du, Yizhi Wang, Weibo Gao, Fangzhou Yao, Li Wang, Ye Liu, Ziyu Xu, Qi Liu, Shimin Di, Min-Ling Zhang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have gradually become a research hotspot due to their outstanding performance in handling complex tasks. Among them, DeepSeek R1 has garnered significant attention for its exceptional performance and open-source nature, driving advancements in the research of R1-style LRMs. Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), these models enhance logical deduction and decision-making capabilities during reasoning by incorporating mechanisms such as long chain-of-thought and self-reflection through reinforcement learning. However, with the widespread application of these models, the problem of overthinking has gradually emerged. Specifically, when generating answers, these models often construct excessively long reasoning chains with redundant or repetitive steps, which leads to reduced reasoning efficiency and may affect the accuracy of the final answer. To this end, various efficient reasoning methods have been proposed, aiming to reduce the length of reasoning paths without compromising model performance and reasoning capability. By reviewing the current research advancements in the field of efficient reasoning methods systematically, we categorize existing works into two main directions based on the lens of single-model optimization versus model collaboration: (1) Efficient Reasoning with Single Model, which focuses on improving the reasoning efficiency of individual models; and (2) Efficient Reasoning with Model Collaboration, which explores optimizing reasoning paths through collaboration among multiple models. Besides, we maintain a public GitHub repository that tracks the latest progress in efficient reasoning methods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I2CR: Intra- and Inter-modal Collaborative Reflections for Multimodal   Entity Linking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02243</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2508.02243.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ziyan Liu, Junwen Li, Kaiwen Li, Tong Ruan, Chao Wang, Xinyan He, Zongyu Wang, Xuezhi Cao, Jingping Liu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Multimodal entity linking plays a crucial role in a wide range of applications. Recent advances in large language model-based methods have become the dominant paradigm for this task, effectively leveraging both textual and visual modalities to enhance performance. Despite their success, these methods still face two challenges, including unnecessary incorporation of image data in certain scenarios and the reliance only on a one-time extraction of visual features, which can undermine their effectiveness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel LLM-based framework for the multimodal entity linking task, called Intra- and Inter-modal Collaborative Reflections. This framework prioritizes leveraging text information to address the task. When text alone is insufficient to link the correct entity through intra- and inter-modality evaluations, it employs a multi-round iterative strategy that integrates key visual clues from various aspects of the image to support reasoning and enhance matching accuracy. Extensive experiments on three widely used public datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in the task, achieving improvements of 3.2%, 5.1%, and 1.6%, respectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/ziyan-xiaoyu/I2CR/.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Visual Document Understanding and Question Answering: A Multi-Agent   Collaboration Framework with Test-Time Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03404</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2508.03404.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Xinlei Yu, Zhangquan Chen, Yudong Zhang, Shilin Lu, Ruolin Shen, Jiangning Zhang, Xiaobin Hu, Yanwei Fu, Shuicheng Yan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Existing vision-language models (VLMs), whether generalists or specialists, remain constrained by their parameter scale, lack robust self-correction capabilities, and underperform in tasks involving long visual contexts and complex reasoning, resulting in suboptimal performance on document-based tasks. To address this, we propose MACT, a Multi-Agent Collaboration framework with Test-Time scaling, tailored for visual document understanding and visual question answering (VQA). It comprises four distinct small-scale agents, i.e., planning, execution, judgment, and answer agents, with clearly defined roles and effective collaboration. Notably, the judgment agent exclusively verifies correctness and redirects to prior agents for revisions, outperforming conventional correction strategies. To further expand the capability boundaries of the framework, we propose mixed reward modeling that balances agent-specific abilities and global collaboration, as well as agent-wise hybrid test-time scaling, which customizes different scaling strategies for each agent based on their functions. Evaluated on benchmarks spanning both document-based and non-document-based settings, our MACT shows superior performance with a smaller parameter scale without sacrificing the ability of general and mathematical tasks. Especially, it stands out in benchmarks involving long visual contexts and complicated reasoning. The three variants of MACT consistently hold the top three positions in average scores, leading in 13 of the 15 benchmarks. Code will be available at: https://github.com/YU-deep/MACT.git.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Are We on the Right Way for Assessing Document Retrieval-Augmented   Generation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03644</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2508.03644.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Wenxuan Shen, Mingjia Wang, Yaochen Wang, Dongping Chen, Junjie Yang, Yao Wan, Weiwei Lin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 13&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show great promise for complex document understanding, yet their development is critically hampered by inadequate evaluation. Current benchmarks often focus on specific part of document RAG system and use synthetic data with incomplete ground truth and evidence labels, therefore failing to reflect real-world bottlenecks and challenges. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Double-Bench: a new large-scale, multilingual, and multimodal evaluation system that is able to produce fine-grained assessment to each component within document RAG systems. It comprises 3,276 documents (72,880 pages) and 5,168 single- and multi-hop queries across 6 languages and 4 document types with streamlined dynamic update support for potential data contamination issues. Queries are grounded in exhaustively scanned evidence pages and verified by human experts to ensure maximum quality and completeness. Our comprehensive experiments across 9 state-of-the-art embedding models, 4 MLLMs and 4 end-to-end document RAG frameworks demonstrate the gap between text and visual embedding models is narrowing, highlighting the need in building stronger document retrieval models. Our findings also reveal the over-confidence dilemma within current document RAG frameworks that tend to provide answer even without evidence support. We hope our fully open-source Double-Bench provide a rigorous foundation for future research in advanced document RAG systems. We plan to retrieve timely corpus and release new benchmarks on an annual basis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>CoAct-1: Computer-using Agents with Coding as Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03923</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2508.03923.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Linxin Song, Yutong Dai, Viraj Prabhu, Jieyu Zhang, Taiwei Shi, Li Li, Junnan Li, Silvio Savarese, Zeyuan Chen, Jieyu Zhao, Ran Xu, Caiming Xiong&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Autonomous agents that operate computers via Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) often struggle with efficiency and reliability on complex, long-horizon tasks. While augmenting these agents with planners can improve task decomposition, they remain constrained by the inherent limitations of performing all actions through GUI manipulation, leading to brittleness and inefficiency. In this work, we introduce a more robust and flexible paradigm: enabling agents to use coding as a enhanced action. We present CoAct-1, a novel multi-agent system that synergistically combines GUI-based control with direct programmatic execution. CoAct-1 features an Orchestrator that dynamically delegates subtasks to either a conventional GUI Operator or a specialized Programmer agent, which can write and execute Python or Bash scripts. This hybrid approach allows the agent to bypass inefficient GUI action sequences for tasks like file management and data processing, while still leveraging visual interaction when necessary. We evaluate our system on the challenging OSWorld benchmark, where CoAct-1 achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 60.76%, significantly outperforming prior methods. Furthermore, our approach dramatically improves efficiency, reducing the average number of steps required to complete a task to just 10.15, compared to 15 for leading GUI agents. Our results demonstrate that integrating coding as a core action provides a more powerful, efficient, and scalable path toward generalized computer automation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Are Today's LLMs Ready to Explain Well-Being Concepts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03990</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2508.03990.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Bohan Jiang, Dawei Li, Zhen Tan, Chengshuai Zhao, Huan Liu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Well-being encompasses mental, physical, and social dimensions essential to personal growth and informed life decisions. As individuals increasingly consult Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand well-being, a key challenge emerges: Can LLMs generate explanations that are not only accurate but also tailored to diverse audiences? High-quality explanations require both factual correctness and the ability to meet the expectations of users with varying expertise. In this work, we construct a large-scale dataset comprising 43,880 explanations of 2,194 well-being concepts, generated by ten diverse LLMs. We introduce a principle-guided LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework, employing dual judges to assess explanation quality. Furthermore, we show that fine-tuning an open-source LLM using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) can significantly enhance the quality of generated explanations. Our results reveal: (1) The proposed LLM judges align well with human evaluations; (2) explanation quality varies significantly across models, audiences, and categories; and (3) DPO- and SFT-finetuned models outperform their larger counterparts, demonstrating the effectiveness of preference-based learning for specialized explanation tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Can Large Multimodal Models Actively Recognize Faulty Inputs? A   Systematic Evaluation Framework of Their Input Scrutiny Ability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04017</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2508.04017.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Haiqi Yang, Jinzhe Li, Gengxu Li, Yi Chang, Yuan Wu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have witnessed remarkable growth, showcasing formidable capabilities in handling intricate multimodal tasks with exceptional performance. Recent research has underscored the inclination of large language models to passively accept defective inputs, often resulting in futile reasoning on invalid prompts. However, the same critical question of whether LMMs can actively detect and scrutinize erroneous inputs still remains unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the Input Scrutiny Ability Evaluation Framework (ISEval), which encompasses seven categories of flawed premises and three evaluation metrics. Our extensive evaluation of ten advanced LMMs has identified key findings. Most models struggle to actively detect flawed textual premises without guidance, which reflects a strong reliance on explicit prompts for premise error identification. Error type affects performance: models excel at identifying logical fallacies but struggle with surface-level linguistic errors and certain conditional flaws. Modality trust varies-Gemini 2.5 pro and Claude Sonnet 4 balance visual and textual info, while aya-vision-8b over-rely on text in conflicts. These insights underscore the urgent need to enhance LMMs' proactive verification of input validity and shed novel insights into mitigating the problem. The code is available at https://github.com/MLGroupJLU/LMM_ISEval.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Potential of MLLMs in Referring Expression Segmentation   via a Light-weight Mask Decode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04107</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2508.04107.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Jingchao Wang, Zhijian Wu, Dingjiang Huang, Yefeng Zheng, Hong Wang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Reference Expression Segmentation (RES) aims to segment image regions specified by referring expressions and has become popular with the rise of multimodal large models (MLLMs). While MLLMs excel in semantic understanding, their token-generation paradigm struggles with pixel-level dense prediction. Existing RES methods either couple MLLMs with the parameter-heavy Segment Anything Model (SAM) with 632M network parameters or adopt SAM-free lightweight pipelines that sacrifice accuracy. To address the trade-off between performance and cost, we specifically propose MLLMSeg, a novel framework that fully exploits the inherent visual detail features encoded in the MLLM vision encoder without introducing an extra visual encoder. Besides, we propose a detail-enhanced and semantic-consistent feature fusion module (DSFF) that fully integrates the detail-related visual feature with the semantic-related feature output by the large language model (LLM) of MLLM. Finally, we establish a light-weight mask decoder with only 34M network parameters that optimally leverages detailed spatial features from the visual encoder and semantic features from the LLM to achieve precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generally surpasses both SAM-based and SAM-free competitors, striking a better balance between performance and cost.

      <title>RPCANet++: Deep Interpretable Robust PCA for Sparse Object Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04190</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2508.04190.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Fengyi Wu, Yimian Dai, Tianfang Zhang, Yixuan Ding, Jian Yang, Ming-Ming Cheng, Zhenming Peng&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) decomposes an observation matrix into low-rank background and sparse object components. This capability has enabled its application in tasks ranging from image restoration to segmentation. However, traditional RPCA models suffer from computational burdens caused by matrix operations, reliance on finely tuned hyperparameters, and rigid priors that limit adaptability in dynamic scenarios. To solve these limitations, we propose RPCANet++, a sparse object segmentation framework that fuses the interpretability of RPCA with efficient deep architectures. Our approach unfolds a relaxed RPCA model into a structured network comprising a Background Approximation Module (BAM), an Object Extraction Module (OEM), and an Image Restoration Module (IRM). To mitigate inter-stage transmission loss in the BAM, we introduce a Memory-Augmented Module (MAM) to enhance background feature preservation, while a Deep Contrast Prior Module (DCPM) leverages saliency cues to expedite object extraction. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that RPCANet++ achieves state-of-the-art performance under various imaging scenarios. We further improve interpretability via visual and numerical low-rankness and sparsity measurements. By combining the theoretical strengths of RPCA with the efficiency of deep networks, our approach sets a new baseline for reliable and interpretable sparse object segmentation.

      <title>Evaluating, Synthesizing, and Enhancing for Customer Support   Conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04423</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2508.04423.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Jie Zhu, Huaixia Dou, Junhui Li, Lifan Guo, Feng Chen, Chi Zhang, Fang Kong&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Effective customer support requires not only accurate problem solving but also structured and empathetic communication aligned with professional standards. However, existing dialogue datasets often lack strategic guidance, and real-world service data is difficult to access and annotate. To address this, we introduce the task of Customer Support Conversation (CSC), aimed at training customer service agents to respond using well-defined support strategies. We propose a structured CSC framework grounded in COPC guidelines, defining five conversational stages and twelve strategies to guide high-quality interactions. Based on this, we construct CSConv, an evaluation dataset of 1,855 real-world customer-agent conversations rewritten using LLMs to reflect deliberate strategy use, and annotated accordingly. Additionally, we develop a role-playing approach that simulates strategy-rich conversations using LLM-powered roles aligned with the CSC framework, resulting in the training dataset RoleCS. Experiments show that fine-tuning strong LLMs on RoleCS significantly improves their ability to generate high-quality, strategy-aligned responses on CSConv. Human evaluations further confirm gains in problem resolution. All code and data will be made publicly available at https://github.com/aliyun/qwen-dianjin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hop, Skip, and Overthink: Diagnosing Why Reasoning Models Fumble during   Multi-Hop Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04699</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2508.04699.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Anushka Yadav, Isha Nalawade, Srujana Pillarichety, Yashwanth Babu, Reshmi Ghosh, Samyadeep Basu, Wenlong Zhao, Ali Nasaeh, Sriram Balasubramanian, Soundararajan Srinivasan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; The emergence of reasoning models and their integration into practical AI chat bots has led to breakthroughs in solving advanced math, deep search, and extractive question answering problems that requires a complex and multi-step thought process. Yet, a complete understanding of why these models hallucinate more than general purpose language models is missing. In this investigative study, we systematicallyexplore reasoning failures of contemporary language models on multi-hop question answering tasks. We introduce a novel, nuanced error categorization framework that examines failures across three critical dimensions: the diversity and uniqueness of source documents involved ("hops"), completeness in capturing relevant information ("coverage"), and cognitive inefficiency ("overthinking"). Through rigorous hu-man annotation, supported by complementary automated metrics, our exploration uncovers intricate error patterns often hidden by accuracy-centric evaluations. This investigative approach provides deeper insights into the cognitive limitations of current models and offers actionable guidance toward enhancing reasoning fidelity, transparency, and robustness in future language modeling efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I Think, Therefore I Am Under-Qualified? A Benchmark for Evaluating   Linguistic Shibboleth Detection in LLM Hiring Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04939</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2508.04939.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Julia Kharchenko, Tanya Roosta, Aman Chadha, Chirag Shah&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how Large Language Models (LLMs) respond to linguistic shibboleths: subtle linguistic markers that can inadvertently reveal demographic attributes such as gender, social class, or regional background. Through carefully constructed interview simulations using 100 validated question-response pairs, we demonstrate how LLMs systematically penalize certain linguistic patterns, particularly hedging language, despite equivalent content quality. Our benchmark generates controlled linguistic variations that isolate specific phenomena while maintaining semantic equivalence, which enables the precise measurement of demographic bias in automated evaluation systems. We validate our approach along multiple linguistic dimensions, showing that hedged responses receive 25.6% lower ratings on average, and demonstrate the benchmark's effectiveness in identifying model-specific biases. This work establishes a foundational framework for detecting and measuring linguistic discrimination in AI systems, with broad applications to fairness in automated decision-making contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>REINA: Regularized Entropy Information-Based Loss for Efficient   Simultaneous Speech Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04946</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2508.04946.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Nameer Hirschkind, Joseph Liu, Mahesh Kumar Nandwana, Xiao Yu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) systems stream in audio while simultaneously emitting translated text or speech. Such systems face the significant challenge of balancing translation quality and latency. We introduce a strategy to optimize this tradeoff: wait for more input only if you gain information by doing so. Based on this strategy, we present Regularized Entropy INformation Adaptation (REINA), a novel loss to train an adaptive policy using an existing non-streaming translation model. We derive REINA from information theory principles and show that REINA helps push the reported Pareto frontier of the latency/quality tradeoff over prior works. Utilizing REINA, we train a SimulST model on French, Spanish and German, both from and into English. Training on only open source or synthetically generated data, we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) streaming results for models of comparable size. We also introduce a metric for streaming efficiency, quantitatively showing REINA improves the latency/quality trade-off by as much as 21% compared to prior approaches, normalized against non-streaming baseline BLEU scores.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Steering One-Step Diffusion Model with Fidelity-Rich Decoder for Fast   Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04979</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2508.04979.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Zheng Chen, Mingde Zhou, Jinpei Guo, Jiale Yuan, Yifei Ji, Yulun Zhang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Diffusion-based image compression has demonstrated impressive perceptual performance. However, it suffers from two critical drawbacks: (1) excessive decoding latency due to multi-step sampling, and (2) poor fidelity resulting from over-reliance on generative priors. To address these issues, we propose SODEC, a novel single-step diffusion image compression model. We argue that in image compression, a sufficiently informative latent renders multi-step refinement unnecessary. Based on this insight, we leverage a pre-trained VAE-based model to produce latents with rich information, and replace the iterative denoising process with a single-step decoding. Meanwhile, to improve fidelity, we introduce the fidelity guidance module, encouraging output that is faithful to the original image. Furthermore, we design the rate annealing training strategy to enable effective training under extremely low bitrates. Extensive experiments show that SODEC significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior rate-distortion-perception performance. Moreover, compared to previous diffusion-based compression models, SODEC improves decoding speed by more than 20times. Code is released at: https://github.com/zhengchen1999/SODEC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>R-Zero: Self-Evolving Reasoning LLM from Zero Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05004</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2508.05004.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Chengsong Huang, Wenhao Yu, Xiaoyang Wang, Hongming Zhang, Zongxia Li, Ruosen Li, Jiaxin Huang, Haitao Mi, Dong Yu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 63&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Self-evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable path toward super-intelligence by autonomously generating, refining, and learning from their own experiences. However, existing methods for training such models still rely heavily on vast human-curated tasks and labels, typically via fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, which poses a fundamental bottleneck to advancing AI systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence. To overcome this limitation, we introduce R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates its own training data from scratch. Starting from a single base LLM, R-Zero initializes two independent models with distinct roles, a Challenger and a Solver. These models are optimized separately and co-evolve through interaction: the Challenger is rewarded for proposing tasks near the edge of the Solver capability, and the Solver is rewarded for solving increasingly challenging tasks posed by the Challenger. This process yields a targeted, self-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels. Empirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across different backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on math-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Attention Basin: Why Contextual Position Matters in Large Language   Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05128</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2508.05128.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Zihao Yi, Delong Zeng, Zhenqing Ling, Haohao Luo, Zhe Xu, Wei Liu, Jian Luan, Wanxia Cao, Ying Shen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is significantly sensitive to the contextual position of information in the input. To investigate the mechanism behind this positional bias, our extensive experiments reveal a consistent phenomenon we term the attention basin: when presented with a sequence of structured items (e.g., retrieved documents or few-shot examples), models systematically assign higher attention to the items at the beginning and end of the sequence, while neglecting those in the middle. Crucially, our analysis further reveals that allocating higher attention to critical information is key to enhancing model performance. Based on these insights, we introduce Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank), a two-stage framework that (i) estimates a model's intrinsic positional attention preferences using a small calibration set, and (ii) reorders retrieved documents or few-shot examples to align the most salient content with these high-attention positions. AttnRank is a model-agnostic, training-free, and plug-and-play method with minimal computational overhead. Experiments on multi-hop QA and few-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that AttnRank achieves substantial improvements across 10 large language models of varying architectures and scales, without modifying model parameters or training procedures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>DeepPHY: Benchmarking Agentic VLMs on Physical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05405</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2508.05405.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Xinrun Xu, Pi Bu, Ye Wang, Börje F. Karlsson, Ziming Wang, Tengtao Song, Qi Zhu, Jun Song, Zhiming Ding, Bo Zheng&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 51&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong perceptual abilities and impressive visual reasoning, they struggle with attention to detail and precise action planning in complex, dynamic environments, leading to subpar performance. Real-world tasks typically require complex interactions, advanced spatial reasoning, long-term planning, and continuous strategy refinement, usually necessitating understanding the physics rules of the target scenario. However, evaluating these capabilities in real-world scenarios is often prohibitively expensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepPHY, a novel benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate VLMs' understanding and reasoning about fundamental physical principles through a series of challenging simulated environments. DeepPHY integrates multiple physical reasoning environments of varying difficulty levels and incorporates fine-grained evaluation metrics. Our evaluation finds that even state-of-the-art VLMs struggle to translate descriptive physical knowledge into precise, predictive control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>InfiAlign: A Scalable and Sample-Efficient Framework for Aligning LLMs   to Enhance Reasoning Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05496</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2508.05496.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Shuo Cai, Su Lu, Qi Zhou, Kejing Yang, Zhijie Sang, Congkai Xie, Hongxia Yang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive reasoning abilities on a wide range of complex tasks. However, enhancing these capabilities through post-training remains resource intensive, particularly in terms of data and computational cost. Although recent efforts have sought to improve sample efficiency through selective data curation, existing methods often rely on heuristic or task-specific strategies that hinder scalability. In this work, we introduce InfiAlign, a scalable and sample-efficient post-training framework that integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align LLMs for enhanced reasoning. At the core of InfiAlign is a robust data selection pipeline that automatically curates high-quality alignment data from open-source reasoning datasets using multidimensional quality metrics. This pipeline enables significant performance gains while drastically reducing data requirements and remains extensible to new data sources. When applied to the Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base model, our SFT model achieves performance on par with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, while using only approximately 12% of the training data, and demonstrates strong generalization across diverse reasoning tasks. Additional improvements are obtained through the application of DPO, with particularly notable gains in mathematical reasoning tasks. The model achieves an average improvement of 3.89% on AIME 24/25 benchmarks. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining principled data selection with full-stage post-training, offering a practical solution for aligning large reasoning models in a scalable and data-efficient manner.

      <title>PRvL: Quantifying the Capabilities and Risks of Large Language Models   for PII Redaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05545</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2508.05545.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Leon Garza, Anantaa Kotal, Aritran Piplai, Lavanya Elluri, Prajit Das, Aman Chadha&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Redacting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from unstructured text is critical for ensuring data privacy in regulated domains. While earlier approaches have relied on rule-based systems and domain-specific Named Entity Recognition (NER) models, these methods fail to generalize across formats and contexts. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative, yet the effect of architectural and training choices on redaction performance remains underexplored. LLMs have demonstrated strong performance in tasks that require contextual language understanding, including the redaction of PII in free-form text. Prior work suggests that with appropriate adaptation, LLMs can become effective contextual privacy learners. However, the consequences of architectural and training choices for PII Redaction remain underexplored. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of LLMs as privacy-preserving PII Redaction systems. We evaluate a range of LLM architectures and training strategies for their effectiveness in PII Redaction. Our analysis measures redaction performance, semantic preservation, and PII leakage, and compares these outcomes against latency and computational cost. The results provide practical guidance for configuring LLM-based redactors that are accurate, efficient, and privacy-aware. To support reproducibility and real-world deployment, we release PRvL, an open-source suite of fine-tuned models, and evaluation tools for general-purpose PII Redaction. PRvL is built entirely on open-source LLMs and supports multiple inference settings for flexibility and compliance. It is designed to be easily customized for different domains and fully operable within secure, self-managed environments. This enables data owners to perform redactions without relying on third-party services or exposing sensitive content beyond their own infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hi3DEval: Advancing 3D Generation Evaluation with Hierarchical Validity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05609</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2508.05609.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yuhan Zhang, Long Zhuo, Ziyang Chu, Tong Wu, Zhibing Li, Liang Pan, Dahua Lin, Ziwei Liu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 21&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Despite rapid advances in 3D content generation, quality assessment for the generated 3D assets remains challenging. Existing methods mainly rely on image-based metrics and operate solely at the object level, limiting their ability to capture spatial coherence, material authenticity, and high-fidelity local details. 1) To address these challenges, we introduce Hi3DEval, a hierarchical evaluation framework tailored for 3D generative content. It combines both object-level and part-level evaluation, enabling holistic assessments across multiple dimensions as well as fine-grained quality analysis. Additionally, we extend texture evaluation beyond aesthetic appearance by explicitly assessing material realism, focusing on attributes such as albedo, saturation, and metallicness. 2) To support this framework, we construct Hi3DBench, a large-scale dataset comprising diverse 3D assets and high-quality annotations, accompanied by a reliable multi-agent annotation pipeline. We further propose a 3D-aware automated scoring system based on hybrid 3D representations. Specifically, we leverage video-based representations for object-level and material-subject evaluations to enhance modeling of spatio-temporal consistency and employ pretrained 3D features for part-level perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing image-based metrics in modeling 3D characteristics and achieves superior alignment with human preference, providing a scalable alternative to manual evaluations.

      <title>Learning to Reason for Factuality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05618</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2508.05618.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Xilun Chen, Ilia Kulikov, Vincent-Pierre Berges, Barlas Oğuz, Rulin Shao, Gargi Ghosh, Jason Weston, Wen-tau Yih&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Reasoning Large Language Models (R-LLMs) have significantly advanced complex reasoning tasks but often struggle with factuality, generating substantially more hallucinations than their non-reasoning counterparts on long-form factuality benchmarks. However, extending online Reinforcement Learning (RL), a key component in recent R-LLM advancements, to the long-form factuality setting poses several unique challenges due to the lack of reliable verification methods. Previous work has utilized automatic factuality evaluation frameworks such as FActScore to curate preference data in the offline RL setting, yet we find that directly leveraging such methods as the reward in online RL leads to reward hacking in multiple ways, such as producing less detailed or relevant responses. We propose a novel reward function that simultaneously considers the factual precision, response detail level, and answer relevance, and applies online RL to learn high quality factual reasoning. Evaluated on six long-form factuality benchmarks, our factual reasoning model achieves an average reduction of 23.1 percentage points in hallucination rate, a 23% increase in answer detail level, and no degradation in the overall response helpfulness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On the Generalization of SFT: A Reinforcement Learning Perspective with   Reward Rectification</title>

Through mathematical analysis, we reveal that standard SFT gradients implicitly encode a problematic reward structure that may severely restrict the generalization capabilities of model. To rectify this, we propose Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), stabilizing gradient updates for each token by dynamically rescaling the objective function with the probability of this token. Remarkably, this single-line code change significantly outperforms standard SFT across multiple challenging benchmarks and base models, demonstrating greatly improved generalization. Additionally, our approach shows competitive results in offline RL settings, offering an effective yet simpler alternative. This work bridges theoretical insight and practical solutions, substantially advancing SFT performance. The code will be available at https://github.com/yongliang-wu/DFT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MOSEv2: A More Challenging Dataset for Video Object Segmentation in   Complex Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05630</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2508.05630.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Henghui Ding, Kaining Ying, Chang Liu, Shuting He, Xudong Jiang, Yu-Gang Jiang, Philip H. S. Torr, Song Bai&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Video object segmentation (VOS) aims to segment specified target objects throughout a video. Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive performance (e.g., 90+% J&amp;F) on existing benchmarks such as DAVIS and YouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated objects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To advance VOS toward more realistic environments, coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1) was introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the strengths and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more challenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world conditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and over 701,976 high-quality masks for 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2 introduces significantly greater scene complexity, including more frequent object disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller objects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g., rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot sequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows, reflections), scenarios requiring external knowledge, etc. We benchmark 20 representative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent performance drops. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9% on MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and find similar declines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 presents challenges across tasks. These results highlight that despite high accuracy on existing datasets, current VOS methods still struggle under real-world complexities. MOSEv2 is publicly available at https://MOSE.video.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

At its core, GE-Base is a large-scale, instruction-conditioned video diffusion model that captures the spatial, temporal, and semantic dynamics of real-world robotic interactions in a structured latent space. Built upon this foundation, GE-Act maps latent representations to executable action trajectories through a lightweight, flow-matching decoder, enabling precise and generalizable policy inference across diverse embodiments with minimal supervision. To support scalable evaluation and training, GE-Sim serves as an action-conditioned neural simulator, producing high-fidelity rollouts for closed-loop policy development. The platform is further equipped with EWMBench, a standardized benchmark suite measuring visual fidelity, physical consistency, and instruction-action alignment. Together, these components establish Genie Envisioner as a scalable and practical foundation for instruction-driven, general-purpose embodied intelligence.
