      <title>AssetFormer: Modular 3D Assets Generation with Autoregressive Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12100</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.12100.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Lingting Zhu, Shengju Qian, Haidi Fan, Jiayu Dong, Zhenchao Jin, Siwei Zhou, Gen Dong, Xin Wang, Lequan Yu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; The digital industry demands high-quality, diverse modular 3D assets, especially for user-generated content~(UGC). In this work, we introduce AssetFormer, an autoregressive Transformer-based model designed to generate modular 3D assets from textual descriptions. Our pilot study leverages real-world modular assets collected from online platforms. AssetFormer tackles the challenge of creating assets composed of primitives that adhere to constrained design parameters for various applications. By innovatively adapting module sequencing and decoding techniques inspired by language models, our approach enhances asset generation quality through autoregressive modeling. Initial results indicate the effectiveness of AssetFormer in streamlining asset creation for professional development and UGC scenarios. This work presents a flexible framework extendable to various types of modular 3D assets, contributing to the broader field of 3D content generation.

      <title>SimToolReal: An Object-Centric Policy for Zero-Shot Dexterous Tool Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16863</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.16863.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Kushal Kedia, Tyler Ga Wei Lum, Jeannette Bohg, C. Karen Liu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 11&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; The ability to manipulate tools significantly expands the set of tasks a robot can perform. Yet, tool manipulation represents a challenging class of dexterity, requiring grasping thin objects, in-hand object rotations, and forceful interactions. Since collecting teleoperation data for these behaviors is challenging, sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising alternative. However, prior approaches typically require substantial engineering effort to model objects and tune reward functions for each task. In this work, we propose SimToolReal, taking a step towards generalizing sim-to-real RL policies for tool manipulation. Instead of focusing on a single object and task, we procedurally generate a large variety of tool-like object primitives in simulation and train a single RL policy with the universal goal of manipulating each object to random goal poses. This approach enables SimToolReal to perform general dexterous tool manipulation at test-time without any object or task-specific training. We demonstrate that SimToolReal outperforms prior retargeting and fixed-grasp methods by 37% while matching the performance of specialist RL policies trained on specific target objects and tasks. Finally, we show that SimToolReal generalizes across a diverse set of everyday tools, achieving strong zero-shot performance over 120 real-world rollouts spanning 24 tasks, 12 object instances, and 6 tool categories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>DODO: Discrete OCR Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16872</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.16872.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Sean Man, Roy Ganz, Roi Ronen, Shahar Tsiper, Shai Mazor, Niv Nayman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a fundamental task for digitizing information, serving as a critical bridge between visual data and textual understanding. While modern Vision-Language Models (VLM) have achieved high accuracy in this domain, they predominantly rely on autoregressive decoding, which becomes computationally expensive and slow for long documents as it requires a sequential forward pass for every generated token. We identify a key opportunity to overcome this bottleneck: unlike open-ended generation, OCR is a highly deterministic task where the visual input strictly dictates a unique output sequence, theoretically enabling efficient, parallel decoding via diffusion models. However, we show that existing masked diffusion models fail to harness this potential; those introduce structural instabilities that are benign in flexible tasks, like captioning, but catastrophic for the rigid, exact-match requirements of OCR. To bridge this gap, we introduce DODO, the first VLM to utilize block discrete diffusion and unlock its speedup potential for OCR. By decomposing generation into blocks, DODO mitigates the synchronization errors of global diffusion. Empirically, our method achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy while enabling up to 3x faster inference compared to autoregressive baselines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Contact-Anchored Proprioceptive Odometry for Quadruped Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17393</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.17393.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Minxing Sun, Yao Mao&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Reliable odometry for legged robots without cameras or LiDAR remains challenging due to IMU drift and noisy joint velocity sensing. This paper presents a purely proprioceptive state estimator that uses only IMU and motor measurements to jointly estimate body pose and velocity, with a unified formulation applicable to biped, quadruped, and wheel-legged robots. The key idea is to treat each contacting leg as a kinematic anchor: joint-torque--based foot wrench estimation selects reliable contacts, and the corresponding footfall positions provide intermittent world-frame constraints that suppress long-term drift. To prevent elevation drift during extended traversal, we introduce a lightweight height clustering and time-decay correction that snaps newly recorded footfall heights to previously observed support planes. To improve foot velocity observations under encoder quantization, we apply an inverse-kinematics cubature Kalman filter that directly filters foot-end velocities from joint angles and velocities. The implementation further mitigates yaw drift through multi-contact geometric consistency and degrades gracefully to a kinematics-derived heading reference when IMU yaw constraints are unavailable or unreliable. We evaluate the method on four quadruped platforms (three Astrall robots and a Unitree Go2 EDU) using closed-loop trajectories. On Astrall point-foot robot~A, a sim200\,m horizontal loop and a sim15\,m vertical loop return with 0.1638\,m and 0.219\,m error, respectively; on wheel-legged robot~B, the corresponding errors are 0.2264\,m and 0.199\,m. On wheel-legged robot~C, a sim700\,m horizontal loop yields 7.68\,m error and a sim20\,m vertical loop yields 0.540\,m error. Unitree Go2 EDU closes a sim120\,m horizontal loop with 2.2138\,m error and a sim8\,m vertical loop with less than 0.1\,m vertical error. github.com/ShineMinxing/Ros2Go2Estimator.git&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>VLANeXt: Recipes for Building Strong VLA Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18532</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.18532.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Xiao-Ming Wu, Bin Fan, Kang Liao, Jian-Jian Jiang, Runze Yang, Yihang Luo, Zhonghua Wu, Wei-Shi Zheng, Chen Change Loy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 39&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Following the rise of large foundation models, Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) emerged, leveraging strong visual and language understanding for general-purpose policy learning. Yet, the current VLA landscape remains fragmented and exploratory. Although many groups have proposed their own VLA models, inconsistencies in training protocols and evaluation settings make it difficult to identify which design choices truly matter. To bring structure to this evolving space, we reexamine the VLA design space under a unified framework and evaluation setup. Starting from a simple VLA baseline similar to RT-2 and OpenVLA, we systematically dissect design choices along three dimensions: foundational components, perception essentials, and action modelling perspectives. From this study, we distill 12 key findings that together form a practical recipe for building strong VLA models. The outcome of this exploration is a simple yet effective model, VLANeXt. VLANeXt outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on the LIBERO and LIBERO-plus benchmarks and demonstrates strong generalization in real-world experiments. We will release a unified, easy-to-use codebase that serves as a common platform for the community to reproduce our findings, explore the design space, and build new VLA variants on top of a shared foundation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SimVLA: A Simple VLA Baseline for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18224</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.18224.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yuankai Luo, Woping Chen, Tong Liang, Baiqiao Wang, Zhenguo Li&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising paradigm for general-purpose robotic manipulation, leveraging large-scale pre-training to achieve strong performance. The field has rapidly evolved with additional spatial priors and diverse architectural innovations. However, these advancements are often accompanied by varying training recipes and implementation details, which can make it challenging to disentangle the precise source of empirical gains. In this work, we introduce SimVLA, a streamlined baseline designed to establish a transparent reference point for VLA research. By strictly decoupling perception from control, using a standard vision-language backbone and a lightweight action head, and standardizing critical training dynamics, we demonstrate that a minimal design can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Despite having only 0.5B parameters, SimVLA outperforms multi-billion-parameter models on standard simulation benchmarks without robot pretraining. SimVLA also reaches on-par real-robot performance compared to pi0.5. Our results establish SimVLA as a robust, reproducible baseline that enables clear attribution of empirical gains to future architectural innovations.

      <title>On the "Induction Bias" in Sequence Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18333</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.18333.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; M. Reza Ebrahimi, Michaël Defferrard, Sunny Panchal, Roland Memisevic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Despite the remarkable practical success of transformer-based language models, recent work has raised concerns about their ability to perform state tracking. In particular, a growing body of literature has shown this limitation primarily through failures in out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, such as length extrapolation. In this work, we shift attention to the in-distribution implications of these limitations. We conduct a large-scale experimental study of the data efficiency of transformers and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) across multiple supervision regimes. We find that the amount of training data required by transformers grows much more rapidly with state-space size and sequence length than for RNNs. Furthermore, we analyze the extent to which learned state-tracking mechanisms are shared across different sequence lengths. We show that transformers exhibit negligible or even detrimental weight sharing across lengths, indicating that they learn length-specific solutions in isolation. In contrast, recurrent models exhibit effective amortized learning by sharing weights across lengths, allowing data from one sequence length to improve performance on others. Together, these results demonstrate that state tracking remains a fundamental challenge for transformers, even when training and evaluation distributions match.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Decoding ML Decision: An Agentic Reasoning Framework for Large-Scale Ranking System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18640</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.18640.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Longfei Yun, Yihan Wu, Haoran Liu, Xiaoxuan Liu, Ziyun Xu, Yi Wang, Yang Xia, Pengfei Wang, Mingze Gao, Yunxiang Wang, Changfan Chen, Junfeng Pan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Modern large-scale ranking systems operate within a sophisticated landscape of competing objectives, operational constraints, and evolving product requirements. Progress in this domain is increasingly bottlenecked by the engineering context constraint: the arduous process of translating ambiguous product intent into reasonable, executable, verifiable hypotheses, rather than by modeling techniques alone. We present GEARS (Generative Engine for Agentic Ranking Systems), a framework that reframes ranking optimization as an autonomous discovery process within a programmable experimentation environment. Rather than treating optimization as static model selection, GEARS leverages Specialized Agent Skills to encapsulate ranking expert knowledge into reusable reasoning capabilities, enabling operators to steer systems via high-level intent vibe personalization. Furthermore, to ensure production reliability, the framework incorporates validation hooks to enforce statistical robustness and filter out brittle policies that overfit short-term signals. Experimental validation across diverse product surfaces demonstrates that GEARS consistently identifies superior, near-Pareto-efficient policies by synergizing algorithmic signals with deep ranking context while maintaining rigorous deployment stability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Large Causal Models for Temporal Causal Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18662</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.18662.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Nikolaos Kougioulis, Nikolaos Gkorgkolis, MingXue Wang, Bora Caglayan, Dario Simionato, Andrea Tonon, Ioannis Tsamardinos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Causal discovery for both cross-sectional and temporal data has traditionally followed a dataset-specific paradigm, where a new model is fitted for each individual dataset. Such an approach limits the potential of multi-dataset pretraining. The concept of large causal models (LCMs) envisions a class of pre-trained neural architectures specifically designed for temporal causal discovery. Prior approaches are constrained to small variable counts, degrade with larger inputs, and rely heavily on synthetic data, limiting generalization. We propose a principled framework for LCMs, combining diverse synthetic generators with realistic time-series datasets, allowing learning at scale. Extensive experiments on synthetic, semi-synthetic and realistic benchmarks show that LCMs scale effectively to higher variable counts and deeper architectures while maintaining strong performance. Trained models achieve competitive or superior accuracy compared to classical and neural baselines, particularly in out-of-distribution settings, while enabling fast, single-pass inference. Results demonstrate LCMs as a promising foundation-model paradigm for temporal causal discovery. Experiments and model weights are available at https://github.com/kougioulis/LCM-paper/.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>RoboCurate: Harnessing Diversity with Action-Verified Neural Trajectory for Robot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18742</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.18742.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Seungku Kim, Suhyeok Jang, Byungjun Yoon, Dongyoung Kim, John Won, Jinwoo Shin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Synthetic data generated by video generative models has shown promise for robot learning as a scalable pipeline, but it often suffers from inconsistent action quality due to imperfectly generated videos. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have been leveraged to validate video quality, but they have limitations in distinguishing physically accurate videos and, even then, cannot directly evaluate the generated actions themselves. To tackle this issue, we introduce RoboCurate, a novel synthetic robot data generation framework that evaluates and filters the quality of annotated actions by comparing them with simulation replay. Specifically, RoboCurate replays the predicted actions in a simulator and assesses action quality by measuring the consistency of motion between the simulator rollout and the generated video. In addition, we unlock observation diversity beyond the available dataset via image-to-image editing and apply action-preserving video-to-video transfer to further augment appearance. We observe RoboCurate's generated data yield substantial relative improvements in success rates compared to using real data only, achieving +70.1% on GR-1 Tabletop (300 demos), +16.1% on DexMimicGen in the pre-training setup, and +179.9% in the challenging real-world ALLEX humanoid dexterous manipulation setting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AAVGen: Precision Engineering of Adeno-associated Viral Capsids for Renal Selective Targeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18915</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.18915.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Mohammadreza Ghaffarzadeh-Esfahani, Yousof Gheisari&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are promising vectors for gene therapy, but their native serotypes face limitations in tissue tropism, immune evasion, and production efficiency. Engineering capsids to overcome these hurdles is challenging due to the vast sequence space and the difficulty of simultaneously optimizing multiple functional properties. The complexity also adds when it comes to the kidney, which presents unique anatomical barriers and cellular targets that require precise and efficient vector engineering. Here, we present AAVGen, a generative artificial intelligence framework for de novo design of AAV capsids with enhanced multi-trait profiles. AAVGen integrates a protein language model (PLM) with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and a reinforcement learning technique termed Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO). The model is guided by a composite reward signal derived from three ESM-2-based regression predictors, each trained to predict a key property: production fitness, kidney tropism, and thermostability. Our results demonstrate that AAVGen produces a diverse library of novel VP1 protein sequences. In silico validations revealed that the majority of the generated variants have superior performance across all three employed indices, indicating successful multi-objective optimization. Furthermore, structural analysis via AlphaFold3 confirms that the generated sequences preserve the canonical capsid folding despite sequence diversification. AAVGen establishes a foundation for data-driven viral vector engineering, accelerating the development of next-generation AAV vectors with tailored functional characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Learning Cross-View Object Correspondence via Cycle-Consistent Mask Prediction</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.18996.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Shannan Yan, Leqi Zheng, Keyu Lv, Jingchen Ni, Hongyang Wei, Jiajun Zhang, Guangting Wang, Jing Lyu, Chun Yuan, Fengyun Rao&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 13&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; We study the task of establishing object-level visual correspondence across different viewpoints in videos, focusing on the challenging egocentric-to-exocentric and exocentric-to-egocentric scenarios. We propose a simple yet effective framework based on conditional binary segmentation, where an object query mask is encoded into a latent representation to guide the localization of the corresponding object in a target video. To encourage robust, view-invariant representations, we introduce a cycle-consistency training objective: the predicted mask in the target view is projected back to the source view to reconstruct the original query mask. This bidirectional constraint provides a strong self-supervisory signal without requiring ground-truth annotations and enables test-time training (TTT) at inference. Experiments on the Ego-Exo4D and HANDAL-X benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our optimization objective and TTT strategy, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The code is available at https://github.com/shannany0606/CCMP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ani3DHuman: Photorealistic 3D Human Animation with Self-guided Stochastic Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19089</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.19089.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Qi Sun, Can Wang, Jiaxiang Shang, Yingchun Liu, Jing Liao&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Current 3D human animation methods struggle to achieve photorealism: kinematics-based approaches lack non-rigid dynamics (e.g., clothing dynamics), while methods that leverage video diffusion priors can synthesize non-rigid motion but suffer from quality artifacts and identity loss. To overcome these limitations, we present Ani3DHuman, a framework that marries kinematics-based animation with video diffusion priors. We first introduce a layered motion representation that disentangles rigid motion from residual non-rigid motion. Rigid motion is generated by a kinematic method, which then produces a coarse rendering to guide the video diffusion model in generating video sequences that restore the residual non-rigid motion. However, this restoration task, based on diffusion sampling, is highly challenging, as the initial renderings are out-of-distribution, causing standard deterministic ODE samplers to fail. Therefore, we propose a novel self-guided stochastic sampling method, which effectively addresses the out-of-distribution problem by combining stochastic sampling (for photorealistic quality) with self-guidance (for identity fidelity). These restored videos provide high-quality supervision, enabling the optimization of the residual non-rigid motion field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \MethodName can generate photorealistic 3D human animation, outperforming existing methods.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.19128.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Shiyi Cao, Ziming Mao, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Ion Stoica&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Optimizing GPU kernels is critical for efficient modern machine learning systems yet remains challenging due to the complex interplay of design factors and rapid hardware evolution. Existing automated approaches typically treat Large Language Models (LLMs) merely as stochastic code generators within heuristic-guided evolutionary loops. These methods often struggle with complex kernels requiring coordinated, multi-step structural transformations, as they lack explicit planning capabilities and frequently discard promising strategies due to inefficient or incorrect intermediate implementations. To address this, we propose Search via Co-Evolving World Model and build K-Search based on this method. By replacing static search heuristics with a co-evolving world model, our framework leverages LLMs' prior domain knowledge to guide the search, actively exploring the optimization space. This approach explicitly decouples high-level algorithmic planning from low-level program instantiation, enabling the system to navigate non-monotonic optimization paths while remaining resilient to temporary implementation defects. We evaluate K-Search on diverse, complex kernels from FlashInfer, including GQA, MLA, and MoE kernels. Our results show that K-Search significantly outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary search methods, achieving an average 2.10x improvement and up to a 14.3x gain on complex MoE kernels. On the GPUMode TriMul task, K-Search achieves state-of-the-art performance on H100, reaching 1030us and surpassing both prior evolution and human-designed solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>TOPReward: Token Probabilities as Hidden Zero-Shot Rewards for Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19313</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.19313.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Shirui Chen, Cole Harrison, Ying-Chun Lee, Angela Jin Yang, Zhongzheng Ren, Lillian J. Ratliff, Jiafei Duan, Dieter Fox, Ranjay Krishna&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 21&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have seen rapid progress in pretraining, their advancement in Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains hampered by low sample efficiency and sparse rewards in real-world settings. Developing generalizable process reward models is essential for providing the fine-grained feedback necessary to bridge this gap, yet existing temporal value functions often fail to generalize beyond their training domains. We introduce TOPReward, a novel, probabilistically grounded temporal value function that leverages the latent world knowledge of pretrained video Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to estimate robotic task progress. Unlike prior methods that prompt VLMs to directly output progress values, which are prone to numerical misrepresentation, TOPReward extracts task progress directly from the VLM's internal token logits. In zero-shot evaluations across 130+ distinct real-world tasks and multiple robot platforms (e.g., Franka, YAM, SO-100/101), TOPReward achieves 0.947 mean Value-Order Correlation (VOC) on Qwen3-VL, dramatically outperforming the state-of-the-art GVL baseline which achieves near-zero correlation on the same open-source model. We further demonstrate that TOPReward serves as a versatile tool for downstream applications, including success detection and reward-aligned behavior cloning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Anatomy of Agentic Memory: Taxonomy and Empirical Analysis of Evaluation and System Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19320</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.19320.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Dongming Jiang, Yi Li, Songtao Wei, Jinxin Yang, Ayushi Kishore, Alysa Zhao, Dingyi Kang, Xu Hu, Feng Chen, Qiannan Li, Bingzhe Li&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Agentic memory systems enable large language model (LLM) agents to maintain state across long interactions, supporting long-horizon reasoning and personalization beyond fixed context windows. Despite rapid architectural development, the empirical foundations of these systems remain fragile: existing benchmarks are often underscaled, evaluation metrics are misaligned with semantic utility, performance varies significantly across backbone models, and system-level costs are frequently overlooked. This survey presents a structured analysis of agentic memory from both architectural and system perspectives. We first introduce a concise taxonomy of MAG systems based on four memory structures. Then, we analyze key pain points limiting current systems, including benchmark saturation effects, metric validity and judge sensitivity, backbone-dependent accuracy, and the latency and throughput overhead introduced by memory maintenance. By connecting the memory structure to empirical limitations, this survey clarifies why current agentic memory systems often underperform their theoretical promise and outlines directions for more reliable evaluation and scalable system design.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SenTSR-Bench: Thinking with Injected Knowledge for Time-Series Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19455</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.19455.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Zelin He, Boran Han, Xiyuan Zhang, Shuai Zhang, Haotian Lin, Qi Zhu, Haoyang Fang, Danielle C. Maddix, Abdul Fatir Ansari, Akash Chandrayan, Abhinav Pradhan, Bernie Wang, Matthew Reimherr&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Time-series diagnostic reasoning is essential for many applications, yet existing solutions face a persistent gap: general reasoning large language models (GRLMs) possess strong reasoning skills but lack the domain-specific knowledge to understand complex time-series patterns. Conversely, fine-tuned time-series LLMs (TSLMs) understand these patterns but lack the capacity to generalize reasoning for more complicated questions. To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid knowledge-injection framework that injects TSLM-generated insights directly into GRLM's reasoning trace, thereby achieving strong time-series reasoning with in-domain knowledge. As collecting data for knowledge injection fine-tuning is costly, we further leverage a reinforcement learning-based approach with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit knowledge-rich traces without human supervision, then transfer such an in-domain thinking trace into GRLM for efficient knowledge injection. We further release SenTSR-Bench, a multivariate time-series-based diagnostic reasoning benchmark collected from real-world industrial operations. Across SenTSR-Bench and other public datasets, our method consistently surpasses TSLMs by 9.1%-26.1% and GRLMs by 7.9%-22.4%, delivering robust, context-aware time-series diagnostic insights.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Nacrith: Neural Lossless Compression via Ensemble Context Modeling and High-Precision CDF Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19626</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.19626.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Roberto Tacconelli&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; We present Nacrith, a lossless compression system that combines a 135M-parameter transformer language model (SmolLM2-135M) with an ensemble of lightweight online predictors and a 32-bit arithmetic coder. Beyond the base LLM-plus-arithmetic-coding paradigm, Nacrith introduces several contributions: (1) a CDF precision upgrade from 2^16 to 2^24 that eliminates ~75% of quantization overhead caused by minimum-probability floors in large vocabularies; (2) a token-level N-gram model for fast local predictions; (3) an adaptive log-space bias head correcting per-document LLM errors via online gradient descent; (4) confidence-based LLM skip for accelerating highly predictable tokens; (5) a hybrid binary format (NC06) extending neural compression to arbitrary binary files--to our knowledge a first among LLM-based compressors; (6) a llama.cpp inference backend achieving ~7x faster single-token decode than PyTorch; (7) parallel multi-GPU compression across up to 8 workers; and (8) native KV cache sliding window reducing per-slide cost by ~37x. The system requires only ~500 MB of GGUF weights and ~1.2 GB VRAM per worker, running on consumer GPUs.   On alice29.txt (Canterbury Corpus, 152 KB), Nacrith achieves 0.918 bits per byte (bpb)--outperforming gzip by 3.1x, bzip2 by 2.5x, CMIX v21 by 44%, and ts_zip by 20%, while compressing below the 0th-, 1st-, and 2nd-order byte-level Shannon entropy bounds. On enwik8 (100 MB), Nacrith achieves 0.9389 bpb (11.74%), surpassing ts_zip (~1.11 bpb) by 15% and FineZip (1.024 bpb) by 8% despite using a 60x smaller model with no fine-tuning. An out-of-distribution evaluation on a document published after the model's training cutoff confirms these gains are not memorization artifacts, achieving 0.723 bpb on unseen text.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SkillOrchestra: Learning to Route Agents via Skill Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19672</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.19672.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Jiayu Wang, Yifei Ming, Zixuan Ke, Shafiq Joty, Aws Albarghouthi, Frederic Sala&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 28&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Compound AI systems promise capabilities beyond those of individual models, yet their success depends critically on effective orchestration. Existing routing approaches face two limitations: (1) input-level routers make coarse query-level decisions that ignore evolving task requirements; (2) RL-trained orchestrators are expensive to adapt and often suffer from routing collapse, repeatedly invoking one strong but costly option in multi-turn scenarios. We introduce SkillOrchestra, a framework for skill-aware orchestration. Instead of directly learning a routing policy end-to-end, SkillOrchestra learns fine-grained skills from execution experience and models agent-specific competence and cost under those skills. At deployment, the orchestrator infers the skill demands of the current interaction and selects agents that best satisfy them under an explicit performance-cost trade-off. Extensive experiments across ten benchmarks demonstrate that SkillOrchestra outperforms SoTA RL-based orchestrators by up to 22.5% with 700x and 300x learning cost reduction compared to Router-R1 and ToolOrchestra, respectively. These results show that explicit skill modeling enables scalable, interpretable, and sample-efficient orchestration, offering a principled alternative to data-intensive RL-based approaches.

      <title>DSDR: Dual-Scale Diversity Regularization for Exploration in LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19895</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.19895.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Zhongwei Wan, Yun Shen, Zhihao Dou, Donghao Zhou, Yu Zhang, Xin Wang, Hui Shen, Jing Xiong, Chaofan Tao, Zixuan Zhong, Peizhou Huang, Mi Zhang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Reinforcement learning with verifiers (RLVR) is a central paradigm for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet existing methods often suffer from limited exploration. Policies tend to collapse onto a few reasoning patterns and prematurely stop deep exploration, while conventional entropy regularization introduces only local stochasticity and fails to induce meaningful path-level diversity, leading to weak and unstable learning signals in group-based policy optimization. We propose DSDR, a Dual-Scale Diversity Regularization reinforcement learning framework that decomposes diversity in LLM reasoning into global and coupling components. Globally, DSDR promotes diversity among correct reasoning trajectories to explore distinct solution modes. Locally, it applies a length-invariant, token-level entropy regularization restricted to correct trajectories, preventing entropy collapse within each mode while preserving correctness. The two scales are coupled through a global-to-local allocation mechanism that emphasizes local regularization for more distinctive correct trajectories. We provide theoretical support showing that DSDR preserves optimal correctness under bounded regularization, sustains informative learning signals in group-based optimization, and yields a principled global-to-local coupling rule. Experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in accuracy and pass@k, highlighting the importance of dual-scale diversity for deep exploration in RLVR.

Over a two-week period, twenty AI researchers interacted with the agents under benign and adversarial conditions. Focusing on failures emerging from the integration of language models with autonomy, tool use, and multi-party communication, we document eleven representative case studies. Observed behaviors include unauthorized compliance with non-owners, disclosure of sensitive information, execution of destructive system-level actions, denial-of-service conditions, uncontrolled resource consumption, identity spoofing vulnerabilities, cross-agent propagation of unsafe practices, and partial system takeover. In several cases, agents reported task completion while the underlying system state contradicted those reports. We also report on some of the failed attempts. Our findings establish the existence of security-, privacy-, and governance-relevant vulnerabilities in realistic deployment settings. These behaviors raise unresolved questions regarding accountability, delegated authority, and responsibility for downstream harms, and warrant urgent attention from legal scholars, policymakers, and researchers across disciplines. This report serves as an initial empirical contribution to that broader conversation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ManCAR: Manifold-Constrained Latent Reasoning with Adaptive Test-Time Computation for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20093</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.20093.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Kun Yang, Yuxuan Zhu, Yazhe Chen, Siyao Zheng, Bangyang Hong, Kangle Wu, Yabo Ni, Anxiang Zeng, Cong Fu, Hui Li&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 18&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Sequential recommendation increasingly employs latent multi-step reasoning to enhance test-time computation. Despite empirical gains, existing approaches largely drive intermediate reasoning states via target-dominant objectives without imposing explicit feasibility constraints. This results in latent drift, where reasoning trajectories deviate into implausible regions. We argue that effective recommendation reasoning should instead be viewed as navigation on a collaborative manifold rather than free-form latent refinement. To this end, we propose ManCAR (Manifold-Constrained Adaptive Reasoning), a principled framework that grounds reasoning within the topology of a global interaction graph. ManCAR constructs a local intent prior from the collaborative neighborhood of a user's recent actions, represented as a distribution over the item simplex. During training, the model progressively aligns its latent predictive distribution with this prior, forcing the reasoning trajectory to remain within the valid manifold. At test time, reasoning proceeds adaptively until the predictive distribution stabilizes, avoiding over-refinement. We provide a variational interpretation of ManCAR to theoretically validate its drift-prevention and adaptive test-time stopping mechanisms. Experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that ManCAR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 46.88% relative improvement w.r.t. NDCG@10.

Video reasoning grounds intelligence in spatiotemporally consistent visual environments that go beyond what text can naturally capture, enabling intuitive reasoning over spatiotemporal structure such as continuity, interaction, and causality. However, systematically studying video reasoning and its scaling behavior is hindered by the lack of large-scale training data. To address this gap, we introduce the Very Big Video Reasoning (VBVR) Dataset, an unprecedentedly large-scale resource spanning 200 curated reasoning tasks following a principled taxonomy and over one million video clips, approximately three orders of magnitude larger than existing datasets. We further present VBVR-Bench, a verifiable evaluation framework that moves beyond model-based judging by incorporating rule-based, human-aligned scorers, enabling reproducible and interpretable diagnosis of video reasoning capabilities. Leveraging the VBVR suite, we conduct one of the first large-scale scaling studies of video reasoning and observe early signs of emergent generalization to unseen reasoning tasks. Together, VBVR lays a foundation for the next stage of research in generalizable video reasoning. The data, benchmark toolkit, and models are publicly available at https://video-reason.com/ .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Our framework efficiently compresses multiple image observations into the fast weights of the TTT layer, forming an implicit 3D representation in the latent space that can be decoded into various explicit formats, such as Gaussian Splats (GS) for downstream applications. The online learning variant of our model supports progressive 3D reconstruction and refinement from streaming observations. We demonstrate that pretraining on novel view synthesis tasks effectively transfers to explicit 3D modeling, resulting in improved reconstruction quality and faster convergence. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior performance in feedforward 3D Gaussian reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art approaches on both objects and scenes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mobile-O: Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation on Mobile Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20161</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2602.20161.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Abdelrahman Shaker, Ahmed Heakl, Jaseel Muhammad, Ritesh Thawkar, Omkar Thawakar, Senmao Li, Hisham Cholakkal, Ian Reid, Eric P. Xing, Salman Khan, Fahad Shahbaz Khan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 18&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Unified multimodal models can both understand and generate visual content within a single architecture. Existing models, however, remain data-hungry and too heavy for deployment on edge devices. We present Mobile-O, a compact vision-language-diffusion model that brings unified multimodal intelligence to a mobile device. Its core module, the Mobile Conditioning Projector (MCP), fuses vision-language features with a diffusion generator using depthwise-separable convolutions and layerwise alignment. This design enables efficient cross-modal conditioning with minimal computational cost. Trained on only a few million samples and post-trained in a novel quadruplet format (generation prompt, image, question, answer), Mobile-O jointly enhances both visual understanding and generation capabilities. Despite its efficiency, Mobile-O attains competitive or superior performance compared to other unified models, achieving 74% on GenEval and outperforming Show-O and JanusFlow by 5% and 11%, while running 6x and 11x faster, respectively. For visual understanding, Mobile-O surpasses them by 15.3% and 5.1% averaged across seven benchmarks. Running in only ~3s per 512x512 image on an iPhone, Mobile-O establishes the first practical framework for real-time unified multimodal understanding and generation on edge devices. We hope Mobile-O will ease future research in real-time unified multimodal intelligence running entirely on-device with no cloud dependency. Our code, models, datasets, and mobile application are publicly available at https://amshaker.github.io/Mobile-O/&lt;/p&gt;</description>
