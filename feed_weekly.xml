      <title>Chat with AI: The Surprising Turn of Real-time Video Communication from   Human to AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10510</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.10510.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Jiangkai Wu, Zhiyuan Ren, Liming Liu, Xinggong Zhang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; AI Video Chat emerges as a new paradigm for Real-time Communication (RTC), where one peer is not a human, but a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This makes interaction between humans and AI more intuitive, as if chatting face-to-face with a real person. However, this poses significant challenges to latency, because the MLLM inference takes up most of the response time, leaving very little time for video streaming. Due to network uncertainty and instability, transmission latency becomes a critical bottleneck preventing AI from being like a real person. To address this, we propose Artic, an AI-oriented Real-time Communication framework, exploring the network requirement shift from "humans watching video" to "AI understanding video". To reduce bitrate dramatically while maintaining MLLM accuracy, we propose Context-Aware Video Streaming that recognizes the importance of each video region for chat and allocates bitrate almost exclusively to chat-important regions. To avoid packet retransmission, we propose Loss-Resilient Adaptive Frame Rate that leverages previous frames to substitute for lost/delayed frames while avoiding bitrate waste. To evaluate the impact of video streaming quality on MLLM accuracy, we build the first benchmark, named Degraded Video Understanding Benchmark (DeViBench). Finally, we discuss some open questions and ongoing solutions for AI Video Chat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>DreamScene: 3D Gaussian-based End-to-end Text-to-3D Scene Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13985</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.13985.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Haoran Li, Yuli Tian, Kun Lan, Yong Liao, Lin Wang, Pan Hui, Peng Yuan Zhou&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Generating 3D scenes from natural language holds great promise for applications in gaming, film, and design. However, existing methods struggle with automation, 3D consistency, and fine-grained control. We present DreamScene, an end-to-end framework for high-quality and editable 3D scene generation from text or dialogue. DreamScene begins with a scene planning module, where a GPT-4 agent infers object semantics and spatial constraints to construct a hybrid graph. A graph-based placement algorithm then produces a structured, collision-free layout. Based on this layout, Formation Pattern Sampling (FPS) generates object geometry using multi-timestep sampling and reconstructive optimization, enabling fast and realistic synthesis. To ensure global consistent, DreamScene employs a progressive camera sampling strategy tailored to both indoor and outdoor settings. Finally, the system supports fine-grained scene editing, including object movement, appearance changes, and 4D dynamic motion. Experiments demonstrate that DreamScene surpasses prior methods in quality, consistency, and flexibility, offering a practical solution for open-domain 3D content creation. Code and demos are available at https://jahnsonblack.github.io/DreamScene-Full/.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>CUDA-L1: Improving CUDA Optimization via Contrastive Reinforcement   Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14111</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.14111.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Xiaoya Li, Xiaofei Sun, Albert Wang, Jiwei Li, Chris Shum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 20&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; The exponential growth in demand for GPU computing resources, driven by the rapid advancement of Large Language Models, has created an urgent need for automated CUDA optimization strategies. While recent advances in LLMs show promise for code generation, current SOTA models (e.g. R1, o1) achieve low success rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an automated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.   CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task: trained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250 CUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the model also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures, achieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40, x14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100. Beyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable properties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns to combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers fundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious performance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that harm performance.   The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can transform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer through speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain knowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning abilities to new kernels. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated optimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU efficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Flow Equivariant Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14793</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.14793.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; T. Anderson Keller&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Data arrives at our senses as a continuous stream, smoothly transforming from one instant to the next. These smooth transformations can be viewed as continuous symmetries of the environment that we inhabit, defining equivalence relations between stimuli over time. In machine learning, neural network architectures that respect symmetries of their data are called equivariant and have provable benefits in terms of generalization ability and sample efficiency. To date, however, equivariance has been considered only for static transformations and feed-forward networks, limiting its applicability to sequence models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and corresponding time-parameterized sequence transformations. In this work, we extend equivariant network theory to this regime of `flows' -- one-parameter Lie subgroups capturing natural transformations over time, such as visual motion. We begin by showing that standard RNNs are generally not flow equivariant: their hidden states fail to transform in a geometrically structured manner for moving stimuli. We then show how flow equivariance can be introduced, and demonstrate that these models significantly outperform their non-equivariant counterparts in terms of training speed, length generalization, and velocity generalization, on both next step prediction and sequence classification. We present this work as a first step towards building sequence models that respect the time-parameterized symmetries which govern the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Deep Researcher with Test-Time Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16075</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.16075.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Rujun Han, Yanfei Chen, Zoey CuiZhu, Lesly Miculicich, Guan Sun, Yuanjun Bi, Weiming Wen, Hui Wan, Chunfeng Wen, Solène Maître, George Lee, Vishy Tirumalashetty, Emily Xue, Zizhao Zhang, Salem Haykal, Burak Gokturk, Tomas Pfister, Chen-Yu Lee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 53&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Deep research agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are rapidly advancing; yet, their performance often plateaus when generating complex, long-form research reports using generic test-time scaling algorithms. Drawing inspiration from the iterative nature of human research, which involves cycles of searching, reasoning, and revision, we propose the Test-Time Diffusion Deep Researcher (TTD-DR). This novel framework conceptualizes research report generation as a diffusion process. TTD-DR initiates this process with a preliminary draft, an updatable skeleton that serves as an evolving foundation to guide the research direction. The draft is then iteratively refined through a "denoising" process, which is dynamically informed by a retrieval mechanism that incorporates external information at each step. The core process is further enhanced by a self-evolutionary algorithm applied to each component of the agentic workflow, ensuring the generation of high-quality context for the diffusion process. This draft-centric design makes the report writing process more timely and coherent while reducing information loss during the iterative search process. We demonstrate that our TTD-DR achieves state-of-the-art results on a wide array of benchmarks that require intensive search and multi-hop reasoning, significantly outperforming existing deep research agents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Frontier AI Risk Management Framework in Practice: A Risk Analysis   Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16534</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.16534.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Shanghai AI Lab, Xiaoyang Chen, Yunhao Chen, Zeren Chen, Zhiyun Chen, Hanyun Cui, Yawen Duan, Jiaxuan Guo, Qi Guo, Xuhao Hu, Hong Huang, Lige Huang, Chunxiao Li, Juncheng Li, Qihao Lin, Dongrui Liu, Xinmin Liu, Zicheng Liu, Chaochao Lu, Xiaoya Lu, Jingjing Qu, Qibing Ren, Jing Shao, Jingwei Shi, Jingwei Sun, Peng Wang, Weibing Wang, Jia Xu, Lewen Yan, Xiao Yu, Yi Yu, Boxuan Zhang, Jie Zhang, Weichen Zhang, Zhijie Zheng, Tianyi Zhou, Bowen Zhou&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; To understand and identify the unprecedented risks posed by rapidly advancing artificial intelligence (AI) models, this report presents a comprehensive assessment of their frontier risks. Drawing on the E-T-C analysis (deployment environment, threat source, enabling capability) from the Frontier AI Risk Management Framework (v1.0) (SafeWork-F1-Framework), we identify critical risks in seven areas: cyber offense, biological and chemical risks, persuasion and manipulation, uncontrolled autonomous AI R\&amp;D, strategic deception and scheming, self-replication, and collusion. Guided by the "AI-45^circ Law," we evaluate these risks using "red lines" (intolerable thresholds) and "yellow lines" (early warning indicators) to define risk zones: green (manageable risk for routine deployment and continuous monitoring), yellow (requiring strengthened mitigations and controlled deployment), and red (necessitating suspension of development and/or deployment). Experimental results show that all recent frontier AI models reside in green and yellow zones, without crossing red lines. Specifically, no evaluated models cross the yellow line for cyber offense or uncontrolled AI R\&amp;D risks. For self-replication, and strategic deception and scheming, most models remain in the green zone, except for certain reasoning models in the yellow zone. In persuasion and manipulation, most models are in the yellow zone due to their effective influence on humans. For biological and chemical risks, we are unable to rule out the possibility of most models residing in the yellow zone, although detailed threat modeling and in-depth assessment are required to make further claims. This work reflects our current understanding of AI frontier risks and urges collective action to mitigate these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Beyond Binary Rewards: Training LMs to Reason About Their Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16806</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.16806.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Mehul Damani, Isha Puri, Stewart Slocum, Idan Shenfeld, Leshem Choshen, Yoon Kim, Jacob Andreas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; When language models (LMs) are trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to generate natural language "reasoning chains", their performance improves on a variety of difficult question answering tasks. Today, almost all successful applications of RL for reasoning use binary reward functions that evaluate the correctness of LM outputs. Because such reward functions do not penalize guessing or low-confidence outputs, they often have the unintended side-effect of degrading calibration and increasing the rate at which LMs generate incorrect responses (or "hallucinate") in other problem domains. This paper describes RLCR (Reinforcement Learning with Calibration Rewards), an approach to training reasoning models that jointly improves accuracy and calibrated confidence estimation. During RLCR, LMs generate both predictions and numerical confidence estimates after reasoning. They are trained to optimize a reward function that augments a binary correctness score with a Brier score -- a scoring rule for confidence estimates that incentivizes calibrated prediction. We first prove that this reward function (or any analogous reward function that uses a bounded, proper scoring rule) yields models whose predictions are both accurate and well-calibrated. We next show that across diverse datasets, RLCR substantially improves calibration with no loss in accuracy, on both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations -- outperforming both ordinary RL training and classifiers trained to assign post-hoc confidence scores. While ordinary RL hurts calibration, RLCR improves it. Finally, we demonstrate that verbalized confidence can be leveraged at test time to improve accuracy and calibration via confidence-weighted scaling methods. Our results show that explicitly optimizing for calibration can produce more generally reliable reasoning models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Met^2Net: A Decoupled Two-Stage Spatio-Temporal Forecasting Model for   Complex Meteorological Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17189</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.17189.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Shaohan Li, Hao Yang, Min Chen, Xiaolin Qin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 12&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; The increasing frequency of extreme weather events due to global climate change urges accurate weather prediction. Recently, great advances have been made by the end-to-end methods, thanks to deep learning techniques, but they face limitations of representation inconsistency in multivariable integration and struggle to effectively capture the dependency between variables, which is required in complex weather systems. Treating different variables as distinct modalities and applying a two-stage training approach from multimodal models can partially alleviate this issue, but due to the inconformity in training tasks between the two stages, the results are often suboptimal. To address these challenges, we propose an implicit two-stage training method, configuring separate encoders and decoders for each variable. In detailed, in the first stage, the Translator is frozen while the Encoders and Decoders learn a shared latent space, in the second stage, the Encoders and Decoders are frozen, and the Translator captures inter-variable interactions for prediction. Besides, by introducing a self-attention mechanism for multivariable fusion in the latent space, the performance achieves further improvements. Empirically, extensive experiments show the state-of-the-art performance of our method. Specifically, it reduces the MSE for near-surface air temperature and relative humidity predictions by 28.82\% and 23.39\%, respectively.

      <title>PRIX: Learning to Plan from Raw Pixels for End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17596</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.17596.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Maciej K. Wozniak, Lianhang Liu, Yixi Cai, Patric Jensfelt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; While end-to-end autonomous driving models show promising results, their practical deployment is often hindered by large model sizes, a reliance on expensive LiDAR sensors and computationally intensive BEV feature representations. This limits their scalability, especially for mass-market vehicles equipped only with cameras. To address these challenges, we propose PRIX (Plan from Raw Pixels). Our novel and efficient end-to-end driving architecture operates using only camera data, without explicit BEV representation and forgoing the need for LiDAR. PRIX leverages a visual feature extractor coupled with a generative planning head to predict safe trajectories from raw pixel inputs directly. A core component of our architecture is the Context-aware Recalibration Transformer (CaRT), a novel module designed to effectively enhance multi-level visual features for more robust planning. We demonstrate through comprehensive experiments that PRIX achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NavSim and nuScenes benchmarks, matching the capabilities of larger, multimodal diffusion planners while being significantly more efficient in terms of inference speed and model size, making it a practical solution for real-world deployment. Our work is open-source and the code will be at https://maxiuw.github.io/prix.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AFRDA: Attentive Feature Refinement for Domain Adaptive Semantic   Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17957</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.17957.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Md. Al-Masrur Khan, Durgakant Pushp, Lantao Liu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; In Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS), a model is trained on labeled source domain data (e.g., synthetic images) and adapted to an unlabeled target domain (e.g., real-world images) without access to target annotations. Existing UDA-SS methods often struggle to balance fine-grained local details with global contextual information, leading to segmentation errors in complex regions. To address this, we introduce the Adaptive Feature Refinement (AFR) module, which enhances segmentation accuracy by refining highresolution features using semantic priors from low-resolution logits. AFR also integrates high-frequency components, which capture fine-grained structures and provide crucial boundary information, improving object delineation. Additionally, AFR adaptively balances local and global information through uncertaintydriven attention, reducing misclassifications. Its lightweight design allows seamless integration into HRDA-based UDA methods, leading to state-of-the-art segmentation performance. Our approach improves existing UDA-SS methods by 1.05% mIoU on GTA V --&gt; Cityscapes and 1.04% mIoU on Synthia--&gt;Cityscapes. The implementation of our framework is available at: https://github.com/Masrur02/AFRDA&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>CLEAR: Error Analysis via LLM-as-a-Judge Made Easy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18392</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.18392.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Asaf Yehudai, Lilach Eden, Yotam Perlitz, Roy Bar-Haim, Michal Shmueli-Scheuer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 17&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly relies on other LLMs acting as judges. However, current evaluation paradigms typically yield a single score or ranking, answering which model is better but not why. While essential for benchmarking, these top-level scores obscure the specific, actionable reasons behind a model's performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce CLEAR, an interactive, open-source package for LLM-based error analysis. CLEAR first generates per-instance textual feedback, then it creates a set of system-level error issues, and quantifies the prevalence of each identified issue. Our package also provides users with an interactive dashboard that allows for a comprehensive error analysis through aggregate visualizations, applies interactive filters to isolate specific issues or score ranges, and drills down to the individual instances that exemplify a particular behavioral pattern. We demonstrate CLEAR analysis for RAG and Math benchmarks, and showcase its utility through a user case study.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Geometry of LLM Quantization: GPTQ as Babai's Nearest Plane   Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18553</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.18553.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Jiale Chen, Torsten Hoefler, Dan Alistarh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 37&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Quantizing the weights of large language models (LLMs) from 16-bit to lower bitwidth is the de facto approach to deploy massive transformers onto more affordable accelerators. GPTQ emerged as one of the standard methods for one-shot post-training quantization at LLM scale. Yet, its inner workings are described as a sequence of ad-hoc algebraic updates that obscure any geometric meaning or worst-case guarantees. In this work, we show that, when executed back-to-front (from the last to first dimension) for a linear layer, GPTQ is mathematically identical to Babai's nearest plane algorithm for the classical closest vector problem (CVP) on a lattice defined by the Hessian matrix of the layer's inputs. This equivalence is based on a sophisticated mathematical argument, and has two analytical consequences: (i) the GPTQ error propagation step gains an intuitive geometric interpretation; (ii) GPTQ inherits the error upper bound of Babai's algorithm under the no-clipping condition. Taken together, these results place GPTQ on firm theoretical footing and open the door to importing decades of progress in lattice algorithms towards the design of future quantization algorithms for billion-parameter models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We introduce Specification Self-Correction (SSC), a novel, test-time framework that enables an LM to identify and correct flaws within its own guiding specification. SSC employs a multi-step inference process where the model first generates a response based on a potentially tainted specification, critiques its output, and then revises the specification itself to remove the exploitable loophole. A final, more robust response is then generated using this self-corrected specification. Across experiments spanning creative writing and agentic coding tasks with several LMs, we demonstrate that while models initially game tainted specifications in 50-70\% of cases, the SSC process reduces this vulnerability by over 90\%. This dynamic repair occurs at inference time, requires no weight modification, and leads to more robustly aligned model behavior.

      <title>ScenePainter: Semantically Consistent Perpetual 3D Scene Generation with   Concept Relation Alignment</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.19058.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Chong Xia, Shengjun Zhang, Fangfu Liu, Chang Liu, Khodchaphun Hirunyaratsameewong, Yueqi Duan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 12&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Perpetual 3D scene generation aims to produce long-range and coherent 3D view sequences, which is applicable for long-term video synthesis and 3D scene reconstruction. Existing methods follow a "navigate-and-imagine" fashion and rely on outpainting for successive view expansion. However, the generated view sequences suffer from semantic drift issue derived from the accumulated deviation of the outpainting module. To tackle this challenge, we propose ScenePainter, a new framework for semantically consistent 3D scene generation, which aligns the outpainter's scene-specific prior with the comprehension of the current scene. To be specific, we introduce a hierarchical graph structure dubbed SceneConceptGraph to construct relations among multi-level scene concepts, which directs the outpainter for consistent novel views and can be dynamically refined to enhance diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework overcomes the semantic drift issue and generates more consistent and immersive 3D view sequences.

      <title>Running in CIRCLE? A Simple Benchmark for LLM Code Interpreter Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19399</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.19399.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Gabriel Chua&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; As large language models (LLMs) increasingly integrate native code interpreters, they enable powerful real-time execution capabilities, substantially expanding their utility. However, such integrations introduce potential system-level cybersecurity threats, fundamentally different from prompt-based vulnerabilities. To systematically evaluate these interpreter-specific risks, we propose CIRCLE (Code-Interpreter Resilience Check for LLM Exploits), a simple benchmark comprising 1,260 prompts targeting CPU, memory, and disk resource exhaustion. Each risk category includes explicitly malicious ("direct") and plausibly benign ("indirect") prompt variants. Our automated evaluation framework assesses not only whether LLMs refuse or generates risky code, but also executes the generated code within the interpreter environment to evaluate code correctness, simplifications made by the LLM to make the code safe, or execution timeouts. Evaluating 7 commercially available models from OpenAI and Google, we uncover significant and inconsistent vulnerabilities. For instance, evaluations show substantial disparities even within providers - OpenAI's o4-mini correctly refuses risky requests at 7.1%, notably higher rates compared to GPT-4.1 at 0.5%. Results particularly underscore that indirect, socially-engineered prompts substantially weaken model defenses. This highlights an urgent need for interpreter-specific cybersecurity benchmarks, dedicated mitigation tools (e.g., guardrails), and clear industry standards to guide safe and responsible deployment of LLM interpreter integrations. The benchmark dataset and evaluation code are publicly released to foster further research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This paper introduces Step-3, a 321B-parameter VLM with hardware-aware model-system co-design optimized for minimizing decoding costs. Step-3 innovates in two key dimensions: (1) A novel Multi-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) mechanism that significantly reduces both KV cache size and computation while maintaining high attention expressiveness, and (2) Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD), a distributed inference system that decouples attention and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers into specialized subsystems. This co-design achieves unprecedented cost efficiency: Step-3 significantly reduces theoretical decoding costs compared with models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B, with the gains widening at longer context. Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per token (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that hardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are critical to cost-effectiveness. We perform a head-to-head comparison with DeepSeek-V3 in its favorable scenarios. Our implementation on Hopper GPUs achieves a decoding throughput of up to 4,039 tokens per second per GPU under 50ms TPOT SLA (4K context, FP8, no MTP). It is higher than DeepSeek-V3's 2,324 in the same setup and sets a new Pareto frontier for LLM decoding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>GEPA: Reflective Prompt Evolution Can Outperform Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19457</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.19457.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Lakshya A Agrawal, Shangyin Tan, Dilara Soylu, Noah Ziems, Rishi Khare, Krista Opsahl-Ong, Arnav Singhvi, Herumb Shandilya, Michael J Ryan, Meng Jiang, Christopher Potts, Koushik Sen, Alexandros G. Dimakis, Ion Stoica, Dan Klein, Matei Zaharia, Omar Khattab&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 20&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks via reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which often require thousands of rollouts to learn new tasks. We argue that the interpretable nature of language can often provide a much richer learning medium for LLMs, compared with policy gradients derived from sparse, scalar rewards. To test this, we introduce GEPA (Genetic-Pareto), a prompt optimizer that thoroughly incorporates natural language reflection to learn high-level rules from trial and error. Given any AI system containing one or more LLM prompts, GEPA samples system-level trajectories (e.g., reasoning, tool calls, and tool outputs) and reflects on them in natural language to diagnose problems, propose and test prompt updates, and combine complementary lessons from the Pareto frontier of its own attempts. As a result of GEPA's design, it can often turn even just a few rollouts into a large quality gain. Across four tasks, GEPA outperforms GRPO by 10% on average and by up to 20%, while using up to 35x fewer rollouts. GEPA also outperforms the leading prompt optimizer, MIPROv2, by over 10% across two LLMs, and demonstrates promising results as an inference-time search strategy for code optimization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MMBench-GUI: Hierarchical Multi-Platform Evaluation Framework for GUI   Agents</title>

It comprises four levels: GUI Content Understanding, Element Grounding, Task Automation, and Task Collaboration, covering essential skills for GUI agents. In addition, we propose a novel Efficiency-Quality Area (EQA) metric to assess GUI agent execution efficiency in online automation scenarios. Through MMBench-GUI, we identify accurate visual grounding as a critical determinant of overall task success, emphasizing the substantial benefits of modular frameworks that integrate specialized grounding modules. Furthermore, to achieve reliable GUI automation, an agent requires strong task planning and cross-platform generalization abilities, with long-context memory, a broad action space, and long-term reasoning playing a critical role. More important, task efficiency remains a critically underexplored dimension, and all models suffer from substantial inefficiencies, with excessive redundant steps even when tasks are ultimately completed. The integration of precise localization, effective planning, and early stopping strategies is indispensable to enable truly efficient and scalable GUI automation. Our benchmark code, evaluation data, and running environment will be publicly available at https://github.com/open-compass/MMBench-GUI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>UloRL:An Ultra-Long Output Reinforcement Learning Approach for Advancing   Large Language Models' Reasoning Abilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19766</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.19766.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Dong Du, Shulin Liu, Tao Yang, Shaohua Chen, Yang Li&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 13&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the potential of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to enhance reasoning capabilities through extended output sequences. However, traditional RL frameworks face inefficiencies when handling ultra-long outputs due to long-tail sequence distributions and entropy collapse during training. To address these challenges, we propose an Ultra-Long Output Reinforcement Learning (UloRL) approach for advancing large language models' reasoning abilities. Specifically, we divide ultra long output decoding into short segments, enabling efficient training by mitigating delays caused by long-tail samples. Additionally, we introduce dynamic masking of well-Mastered Positive Tokens (MPTs) to prevent entropy collapse. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. On the Qwen3-30B-A3B model, RL with segment rollout achieved 2.06x increase in training speed, while RL training with 128k-token outputs improves the model's performance on AIME2025 from 70.9\% to 85.1\% and on BeyondAIME from 50.7\% to 61.9\%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B with remarkable gains. These findings underscore the potential of our methods to advance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with ultra-long sequence generation. We will release our code and model for further use by the community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ForCenNet: Foreground-Centric Network for Document Image Rectification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19804</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.19804.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Peng Cai, Qiang Li, Kaicheng Yang, Dong Guo, Jia Li, Nan Zhou, Xiang An, Ninghua Yang, Jiankang Deng&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 11&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Document image rectification aims to eliminate geometric deformation in photographed documents to facilitate text recognition. However, existing methods often neglect the significance of foreground elements, which provide essential geometric references and layout information for document image correction. In this paper, we introduce Foreground-Centric Network (ForCenNet) to eliminate geometric distortions in document images. Specifically, we initially propose a foreground-centric label generation method, which extracts detailed foreground elements from an undistorted image. Then we introduce a foreground-centric mask mechanism to enhance the distinction between readable and background regions. Furthermore, we design a curvature consistency loss to leverage the detailed foreground labels to help the model understand the distorted geometric distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ForCenNet achieves new state-of-the-art on four real-world benchmarks, such as DocUNet, DIR300, WarpDoc, and DocReal. Quantitative analysis shows that the proposed method effectively undistorts layout elements, such as text lines and table borders.

      <title>Agentic Reinforced Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19849</link>

In realistic reasoning scenarios, LLMs can often utilize external tools to assist in task-solving processes. However, current RL algorithms inadequately balance the models' intrinsic long-horizon reasoning capabilities and their proficiency in multi-turn tool interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose Agentic Reinforced Policy Optimization (ARPO), a novel agentic RL algorithm tailored for training multi-turn LLM-based agents. Through preliminary experiments, we observe that LLMs tend to exhibit highly uncertain behavior, characterized by an increase in the entropy distribution of generated tokens, immediately following interactions with external tools. Motivated by this observation, ARPO incorporates an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism, dynamically balancing global trajectory sampling and step-level sampling, thereby promoting exploration at steps with high uncertainty after tool usage. By integrating an advantage attribution estimation, ARPO enables LLMs to internalize advantage differences in stepwise tool-use interactions. Our experiments across 13 challenging benchmarks in computational reasoning, knowledge reasoning, and deep search domains demonstrate ARPO's superiority over trajectory-level RL algorithms. Remarkably, ARPO achieves improved performance using only half of the tool-use budget required by existing methods, offering a scalable solution for aligning LLM-based agents with real-time dynamic environments. Our code and datasets are released at https://github.com/dongguanting/ARPO&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Region-based Cluster Discrimination for Visual Representation Learning</title>

Although recent vision-language contrastive models, such as CLIP and SigLIP, have achieved impressive zero-shot performance via large-scale vision-language alignment, their reliance on global representations constrains their effectiveness for dense prediction tasks, such as grounding, OCR, and segmentation. To address this gap, we introduce Region-Aware Cluster Discrimination (RICE), a novel method that enhances region-level visual and OCR capabilities. We first construct a billion-scale candidate region dataset and propose a Region Transformer layer to extract rich regional semantics. We further design a unified region cluster discrimination loss that jointly supports object and OCR learning within a single classification framework, enabling efficient and scalable distributed training on large-scale data. Extensive experiments show that RICE consistently outperforms previous methods on tasks, including segmentation, dense detection, and visual perception for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The pre-trained models have been released at https://github.com/deepglint/MVT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MaPPO: Maximum a Posteriori Preference Optimization with Prior Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21183</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.21183.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Guangchen Lan, Sipeng Zhang, Tianle Wang, Yuwei Zhang, Daoan Zhang, Xinpeng Wei, Xiaoman Pan, Hongming Zhang, Dong-Jun Han, Christopher G. Brinton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 12&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; As the era of large language models (LLMs) on behalf of users unfolds, Preference Optimization (PO) methods have become a central approach to aligning LLMs with human preferences and improving performance. We propose Maximum a Posteriori Preference Optimization (MaPPO), a framework for learning from preferences that explicitly incorporates prior reward knowledge into the optimization objective. While existing methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants treat preference learning as a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem, MaPPO extends this paradigm by integrating prior reward estimates into a principled Maximum a Posteriori (MaP) objective. This not only generalizes DPO and its variants, but also enhances alignment by mitigating the oversimplified binary classification of responses. More importantly, MaPPO introduces no additional hyperparameter, and supports preference optimization in both offline and online settings. In addition, MaPPO can be used as a plugin with consistent improvement on DPO variants, including widely used SimPO, IPO, and CPO. Extensive empirical evaluations of different model sizes and model series on three standard benchmarks, including MT-Bench, AlpacaEval 2.0, and Arena-Hard, demonstrate consistent improvements in alignment performance without sacrificing computational efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Goal Alignment in LLM-Based User Simulators for Conversational AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20152</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.20152.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Shuhaib Mehri, Xiaocheng Yang, Takyoung Kim, Gokhan Tur, Shikib Mehri, Dilek Hakkani-Tür&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; User simulators are essential to conversational AI, enabling scalable agent development and evaluation through simulated interactions. While current Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced user simulation capabilities, we reveal that they struggle to consistently demonstrate goal-oriented behavior across multi-turn conversations--a critical limitation that compromises their reliability in downstream applications. We introduce User Goal State Tracking (UGST), a novel framework that tracks user goal progression throughout conversations. Leveraging UGST, we present a three-stage methodology for developing user simulators that can autonomously track goal progression and reason to generate goal-aligned responses. Moreover, we establish comprehensive evaluation metrics for measuring goal alignment in user simulators, and demonstrate that our approach yields substantial improvements across two benchmarks (MultiWOZ 2.4 and {\tau}-Bench). Our contributions address a critical gap in conversational AI and establish UGST as an essential framework for developing goal-aligned user simulators.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Diversity-Enhanced Reasoning for Subjective Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20187</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.20187.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yumeng Wang, Zhiyuan Fan, Jiayu Liu, Yi R. Fung&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 22&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Large reasoning models (LRM) with long chain-of-thought (CoT) capabilities have shown strong performance on objective tasks, such as math reasoning and coding. However, their effectiveness on subjective questions that may have different responses from different perspectives is still limited by a tendency towards homogeneous reasoning, introduced by the reliance on a single ground truth in supervised fine-tuning and verifiable reward in reinforcement learning. Motivated by the finding that increasing role perspectives consistently improves performance, we propose MultiRole-R1, a diversity-enhanced framework with multiple role perspectives, to improve the accuracy and diversity in subjective reasoning tasks. MultiRole-R1 features an unsupervised data construction pipeline that generates reasoning chains that incorporate diverse role perspectives. We further employ reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with reward shaping, by taking diversity as a reward signal in addition to the verifiable reward. With specially designed reward functions, we successfully promote perspective diversity and lexical diversity, uncovering a positive relation between reasoning diversity and accuracy. Our experiment on six benchmarks demonstrates MultiRole-R1's effectiveness and generalizability in enhancing both subjective and objective reasoning, showcasing the potential of diversity-enhanced training in LRMs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>When Tokens Talk Too Much: A Survey of Multimodal Long-Context Token   Compression across Images, Videos, and Audios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20198</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.20198.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Kele Shao, Keda Tao, Kejia Zhang, Sicheng Feng, Mu Cai, Yuzhang Shang, Haoxuan You, Can Qin, Yang Sui, Huan Wang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 23&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable strides, largely driven by their ability to process increasingly long and complex contexts, such as high-resolution images, extended video sequences, and lengthy audio input. While this ability significantly enhances MLLM capabilities, it introduces substantial computational challenges, primarily due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms with numerous input tokens. To mitigate these bottlenecks, token compression has emerged as an auspicious and critical approach, efficiently reducing the number of tokens during both training and inference. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey and synthesis of the burgeoning field of multimodal long context token compression. Recognizing that effective compression strategies are deeply tied to the unique characteristics and redundancies of each modality, we categorize existing approaches by their primary data focus, enabling researchers to quickly access and learn methods tailored to their specific area of interest: (1) image-centric compression, which addresses spatial redundancy in visual data; (2) video-centric compression, which tackles spatio-temporal redundancy in dynamic sequences; and (3) audio-centric compression, which handles temporal and spectral redundancy in acoustic signals. Beyond this modality-driven categorization, we further dissect methods based on their underlying mechanisms, including transformation-based, similarity-based, attention-based, and query-based approaches. By providing a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to consolidate current progress, identify key challenges, and inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain. We also maintain a public repository to continuously track and update the latest advances in this promising area.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AnimalClue: Recognizing Animals by their Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20240</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.20240.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Risa Shinoda, Nakamasa Inoue, Iro Laina, Christian Rupprecht, Hirokatsu Kataoka&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 9&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Wildlife observation plays an important role in biodiversity conservation, necessitating robust methodologies for monitoring wildlife populations and interspecies interactions. Recent advances in computer vision have significantly contributed to automating fundamental wildlife observation tasks, such as animal detection and species identification. However, accurately identifying species from indirect evidence like footprints and feces remains relatively underexplored, despite its importance in contributing to wildlife monitoring. To bridge this gap, we introduce AnimalClue, the first large-scale dataset for species identification from images of indirect evidence. Our dataset consists of 159,605 bounding boxes encompassing five categories of indirect clues: footprints, feces, eggs, bones, and feathers. It covers 968 species, 200 families, and 65 orders. Each image is annotated with species-level labels, bounding boxes or segmentation masks, and fine-grained trait information, including activity patterns and habitat preferences. Unlike existing datasets primarily focused on direct visual features (e.g., animal appearances), AnimalClue presents unique challenges for classification, detection, and instance segmentation tasks due to the need for recognizing more detailed and subtle visual features. In our experiments, we extensively evaluate representative vision models and identify key challenges in animal identification from their traces. Our dataset and code are available at https://dahlian00.github.io/AnimalCluePage/&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MIRepNet: A Pipeline and Foundation Model for EEG-Based Motor Imagery   Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20254</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.20254.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Dingkun Liu, Zhu Chen, Jingwei Luo, Shijie Lian, Dongrui Wu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 18&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable direct communication between the brain and external devices. Recent EEG foundation models aim to learn generalized representations across diverse BCI paradigms. However, these approaches overlook fundamental paradigm-specific neurophysiological distinctions, limiting their generalization ability. Importantly, in practical BCI deployments, the specific paradigm such as motor imagery (MI) for stroke rehabilitation or assistive robotics, is generally determined prior to data acquisition. This paper proposes MIRepNet, the first EEG foundation model tailored for the MI paradigm. MIRepNet comprises a high-quality EEG preprocessing pipeline incorporating a neurophysiologically-informed channel template, adaptable to EEG headsets with arbitrary electrode configurations. Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid pretraining strategy that combines self-supervised masked token reconstruction and supervised MI classification, facilitating rapid adaptation and accurate decoding on novel downstream MI tasks with fewer than 30 trials per class. Extensive evaluations across five public MI datasets demonstrated that MIRepNet consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both specialized and generalized EEG models. Our code will be available on GitHubhttps://github.com/staraink/MIRepNet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AgroBench: Vision-Language Model Benchmark in Agriculture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20519</link>

Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) are expected to further expand the range of agricultural tasks by facilitating human-model interaction through easy, text-based communication. Here, we introduce AgroBench (Agronomist AI Benchmark), a benchmark for evaluating VLM models across seven agricultural topics, covering key areas in agricultural engineering and relevant to real-world farming. Unlike recent agricultural VLM benchmarks, AgroBench is annotated by expert agronomists. Our AgroBench covers a state-of-the-art range of categories, including 203 crop categories and 682 disease categories, to thoroughly evaluate VLM capabilities. In our evaluation on AgroBench, we reveal that VLMs have room for improvement in fine-grained identification tasks. Notably, in weed identification, most open-source VLMs perform close to random. With our wide range of topics and expert-annotated categories, we analyze the types of errors made by VLMs and suggest potential pathways for future VLM development.

      <title>SAND-Math: Using LLMs to Generate Novel, Difficult and Useful   Mathematics Questions and Answers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20527</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.20527.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Chaitanya Manem, Pratik Prabhanjan Brahma, Prakamya Mishra, Zicheng Liu, Emad Barsoum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; The demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of sophisticated mathematical reasoning is growing across industries. However, the development of performant mathematical LLMs is critically bottlenecked by the scarcity of difficult, novel training data. We introduce SAND-Math (Synthetic Augmented Novel and Difficult Mathematics problems and solutions), a pipeline that addresses this by first generating high-quality problems from scratch and then systematically elevating their complexity via a new Difficulty Hiking step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two key findings. First, augmenting a strong baseline with SAND-Math data significantly boosts performance, outperforming the next-best synthetic dataset by uparrow 17.85 absolute points on the AIME25 benchmark. Second, in a dedicated ablation study, we show our Difficulty Hiking process is highly effective: by increasing average problem difficulty from 5.02 to 5.98, this step lifts AIME25 performance from 46.38\% to 49.23\%. The full generation pipeline, final dataset, and a fine-tuned model form a practical and scalable toolkit for building more capable and efficient mathematical reasoning LLMs. SAND-Math dataset is released here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/amd/SAND-MATH{https://huggingface.co/datasets/amd/SAND-MATH}&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20673</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.20673.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yuzhong Zhao, Yue Liu, Junpeng Liu, Jingye Chen, Xun Wu, Yaru Hao, Tengchao Lv, Shaohan Huang, Lei Cui, Qixiang Ye, Fang Wan, Furu Wei&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 30&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Recent advancements, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models by optimizing the arithmetic mean of token-level rewards. However, GRPO suffers from unstable policy updates when processing tokens with outlier importance-weighted rewards, which manifests as extreme importance sampling ratios during training, i.e., the ratio between the sampling probabilities assigned to a token by the current and old policies. In this work, we propose Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization (GMPO), a stabilized variant of GRPO. Instead of optimizing the arithmetic mean, GMPO maximizes the geometric mean of token-level rewards, which is inherently less sensitive to outliers and maintains a more stable range of importance sampling ratio. In addition, we provide comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis to justify the design and stability benefits of GMPO. Beyond improved stability, GMPO-7B outperforms GRPO by an average of 4.1% on multiple mathematical benchmarks and 1.4% on multimodal reasoning benchmark, including AIME24, AMC, MATH500, OlympiadBench, Minerva, and Geometry3K.

      <title>JAM: A Tiny Flow-based Song Generator with Fine-grained Controllability   and Aesthetic Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20880</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.20880.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Renhang Liu, Chia-Yu Hung, Navonil Majumder, Taylor Gautreaux, Amir Ali Bagherzadeh, Chuan Li, Dorien Herremans, Soujanya Poria&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Diffusion and flow-matching models have revolutionized automatic text-to-audio generation in recent times. These models are increasingly capable of generating high quality and faithful audio outputs capturing to speech and acoustic events. However, there is still much room for improvement in creative audio generation that primarily involves music and songs. Recent open lyrics-to-song models, such as, DiffRhythm, ACE-Step, and LeVo, have set an acceptable standard in automatic song generation for recreational use. However, these models lack fine-grained word-level controllability often desired by musicians in their workflows. To the best of our knowledge, our flow-matching-based JAM is the first effort toward endowing word-level timing and duration control in song generation, allowing fine-grained vocal control. To enhance the quality of generated songs to better align with human preferences, we implement aesthetic alignment through Direct Preference Optimization, which iteratively refines the model using a synthetic dataset, eliminating the need or manual data annotations. Furthermore, we aim to standardize the evaluation of such lyrics-to-song models through our public evaluation dataset JAME. We show that JAM outperforms the existing models in terms of the music-specific attributes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Music Arena: Live Evaluation for Text-to-Music</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.20900.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yonghyun Kim, Wayne Chi, Anastasios N. Angelopoulos, Wei-Lin Chiang, Koichi Saito, Shinji Watanabe, Yuki Mitsufuji, Chris Donahue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; We present Music Arena, an open platform for scalable human preference evaluation of text-to-music (TTM) models. Soliciting human preferences via listening studies is the gold standard for evaluation in TTM, but these studies are expensive to conduct and difficult to compare, as study protocols may differ across systems. Moreover, human preferences might help researchers align their TTM systems or improve automatic evaluation metrics, but an open and renewable source of preferences does not currently exist. We aim to fill these gaps by offering *live* evaluation for TTM. In Music Arena, real-world users input text prompts of their choosing and compare outputs from two TTM systems, and their preferences are used to compile a leaderboard. While Music Arena follows recent evaluation trends in other AI domains, we also design it with key features tailored to music: an LLM-based routing system to navigate the heterogeneous type signatures of TTM systems, and the collection of *detailed* preferences including listening data and natural language feedback. We also propose a rolling data release policy with user privacy guarantees, providing a renewable source of preference data and increasing platform transparency. Through its standardized evaluation protocol, transparent data access policies, and music-specific features, Music Arena not only addresses key challenges in the TTM ecosystem but also demonstrates how live evaluation can be thoughtfully adapted to unique characteristics of specific AI domains.

      <title>ARC-Hunyuan-Video-7B: Structured Video Comprehension of Real-World   Shorts</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.20939.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yuying Ge, Yixiao Ge, Chen Li, Teng Wang, Junfu Pu, Yizhuo Li, Lu Qiu, Jin Ma, Lisheng Duan, Xinyu Zuo, Jinwen Luo, Weibo Gu, Zexuan Li, Xiaojing Zhang, Yangyu Tao, Han Hu, Di Wang, Ying Shan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 55&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Real-world user-generated short videos, especially those distributed on platforms such as WeChat Channel and TikTok, dominate the mobile internet. However, current large multimodal models lack essential temporally-structured, detailed, and in-depth video comprehension capabilities, which are the cornerstone of effective video search and recommendation, as well as emerging video applications. Understanding real-world shorts is actually challenging due to their complex visual elements, high information density in both visuals and audio, and fast pacing that focuses on emotional expression and viewpoint delivery. This requires advanced reasoning to effectively integrate multimodal information, including visual, audio, and text. In this work, we introduce ARC-Hunyuan-Video, a multimodal model that processes visual, audio, and textual signals from raw video inputs end-to-end for structured comprehension. The model is capable of multi-granularity timestamped video captioning and summarization, open-ended video question answering, temporal video grounding, and video reasoning. Leveraging high-quality data from an automated annotation pipeline, our compact 7B-parameter model is trained through a comprehensive regimen: pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, cold start, reinforcement learning (RL) post-training, and final instruction fine-tuning. Quantitative evaluations on our introduced benchmark ShortVid-Bench and qualitative comparisons demonstrate its strong performance in real-world video comprehension, and it supports zero-shot or fine-tuning with a few samples for diverse downstream applications. The real-world production deployment of our model has yielded tangible and measurable improvements in user engagement and satisfaction, a success supported by its remarkable efficiency, with stress tests indicating an inference time of just 10 seconds for a one-minute video on H20 GPU.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Adapting Vehicle Detectors for Aerial Imagery to Unseen Domains with   Weak Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20976</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.20976.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Xiao Fang, Minhyek Jeon, Zheyang Qin, Stanislav Panev, Celso de Melo, Shuowen Hu, Shayok Chakraborty, Fernando De la Torre&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Detecting vehicles in aerial imagery is a critical task with applications in traffic monitoring, urban planning, and defense intelligence. Deep learning methods have provided state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for this application. However, a significant challenge arises when models trained on data from one geographic region fail to generalize effectively to other areas. Variability in factors such as environmental conditions, urban layouts, road networks, vehicle types, and image acquisition parameters (e.g., resolution, lighting, and angle) leads to domain shifts that degrade model performance. This paper proposes a novel method that uses generative AI to synthesize high-quality aerial images and their labels, improving detector training through data augmentation. Our key contribution is the development of a multi-stage, multi-modal knowledge transfer framework utilizing fine-tuned latent diffusion models (LDMs) to mitigate the distribution gap between the source and target environments. Extensive experiments across diverse aerial imagery domains show consistent performance improvements in AP50 over supervised learning on source domain data, weakly supervised adaptation methods, unsupervised domain adaptation methods, and open-set object detectors by 4-23%, 6-10%, 7-40%, and more than 50%, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce two newly annotated aerial datasets from New Zealand and Utah to support further research in this field.

      <title>SmallThinker: A Family of Efficient Large Language Models Natively   Trained for Local Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20984</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.20984.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yixin Song, Zhenliang Xue, Dongliang Wei, Feiyang Chen, Jianxiang Gao, Junchen Liu, Hangyu Liang, Guangshuo Qin, Chengrong Tian, Bo Wen, Longyu Zhao, Xinrui Zheng, Zeyu Mi, Haibo Chen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 50&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; While frontier large language models (LLMs) continue to push capability boundaries, their deployment remains confined to GPU-powered cloud infrastructure. We challenge this paradigm with SmallThinker, a family of LLMs natively designed - not adapted - for the unique constraints of local devices: weak computational power, limited memory, and slow storage. Unlike traditional approaches that mainly compress existing models built for clouds, we architect SmallThinker from the ground up to thrive within these limitations. Our innovation lies in a deployment-aware architecture that transforms constraints into design principles. First, We introduce a two-level sparse structure combining fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with sparse feed-forward networks, drastically reducing computational demands without sacrificing model capacity. Second, to conquer the I/O bottleneck of slow storage, we design a pre-attention router that enables our co-designed inference engine to prefetch expert parameters from storage while computing attention, effectively hiding storage latency that would otherwise cripple on-device inference. Third, for memory efficiency, we utilize NoPE-RoPE hybrid sparse attention mechanism to slash KV cache requirements. We release SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B and SmallThinker-21B-A3B, which achieve state-of-the-art performance scores and even outperform larger LLMs. Remarkably, our co-designed system mostly eliminates the need for expensive GPU hardware: with Q4_0 quantization, both models exceed 20 tokens/s on ordinary consumer CPUs, while consuming only 1GB and 8GB of memory respectively. SmallThinker is publicly available at hf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-4BA0.6B-Instruct and hf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-21BA3B-Instruct.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, the proprietary nature of these models and their training data creates a significant barrier for open-source research. To bridge this gap, we introduce GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M, a publicly available, large-scale image-editing corpus containing more than 1.5 million high-quality triplets (instruction, source image, edited image). We systematically construct this dataset by leveraging the versatile capabilities of GPT-4o to unify and refine three popular image-editing datasets: OmniEdit, HQ-Edit, and UltraEdit. Specifically, our methodology involves 1) regenerating output images to enhance visual quality and instruction alignment, and 2) selectively rewriting prompts to improve semantic clarity. To validate the efficacy of our dataset, we fine-tune advanced open-source models on GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M. The empirical results are exciting, e.g., the fine-tuned FluxKontext achieves highly competitive performance across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks, including 7.24 on GEdit-EN, 3.80 on ImgEdit-Full, and 8.78 on Complex-Edit, showing stronger instruction following and higher perceptual quality while maintaining identity. These scores markedly exceed all previously published open-source methods and substantially narrow the gap to leading proprietary models. We hope the full release of GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M can help to catalyze further open research in instruction-guided image editing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>GenoMAS: A Multi-Agent Framework for Scientific Discovery via   Code-Driven Gene Expression Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21035</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.21035.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Haoyang Liu, Yijiang Li, Haohan Wang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Gene expression analysis holds the key to many biomedical discoveries, yet extracting insights from raw transcriptomic data remains formidable due to the complexity of multiple large, semi-structured files and the need for extensive domain expertise. Current automation approaches are often limited by either inflexible workflows that break down in edge cases or by fully autonomous agents that lack the necessary precision for rigorous scientific inquiry. GenoMAS charts a different course by presenting a team of LLM-based scientists that integrates the reliability of structured workflows with the adaptability of autonomous agents. GenoMAS orchestrates six specialized LLM agents through typed message-passing protocols, each contributing complementary strengths to a shared analytic canvas. At the heart of GenoMAS lies a guided-planning framework: programming agents unfold high-level task guidelines into Action Units and, at each juncture, elect to advance, revise, bypass, or backtrack, thereby maintaining logical coherence while bending gracefully to the idiosyncrasies of genomic data.   On the GenoTEX benchmark, GenoMAS reaches a Composite Similarity Correlation of 89.13% for data preprocessing and an F_1 of 60.48% for gene identification, surpassing the best prior art by 10.61% and 16.85% respectively. Beyond metrics, GenoMAS surfaces biologically plausible gene-phenotype associations corroborated by the literature, all while adjusting for latent confounders.

      <title>Reconstructing 4D Spatial Intelligence: A Survey</title>

These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the focus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI, which emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid advances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has evolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally, existing surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical structure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new perspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D spatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes (e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene components (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction of 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene components; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints. We conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and highlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D spatial intelligence. To track ongoing developments, we maintain an up-to-date project page: https://github.com/yukangcao/Awesome-4D-Spatial-Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Survey of Self-Evolving Agents: On Path to Artificial Super   Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21046</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.21046.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Huan-ang Gao, Jiayi Geng, Wenyue Hua, Mengkang Hu, Xinzhe Juan, Hongzhang Liu, Shilong Liu, Jiahao Qiu, Xuan Qi, Yiran Wu, Hongru Wang, Han Xiao, Yuhang Zhou, Shaokun Zhang, Jiayi Zhang, Jinyu Xiang, Yixiong Fang, Qiwen Zhao, Dongrui Liu, Qihan Ren, Cheng Qian, Zhenghailong Wang, Minda Hu, Huazheng Wang, Qingyun Wu, Heng Ji, Mengdi Wang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 72&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities but remain fundamentally static, unable to adapt their internal parameters to novel tasks, evolving knowledge domains, or dynamic interaction contexts. As LLMs are increasingly deployed in open-ended, interactive environments, this static nature has become a critical bottleneck, necessitating agents that can adaptively reason, act, and evolve in real time. This paradigm shift -- from scaling static models to developing self-evolving agents -- has sparked growing interest in architectures and methods enabling continual learning and adaptation from data, interactions, and experiences. This survey provides the first systematic and comprehensive review of self-evolving agents, organized around three foundational dimensions -- what to evolve, when to evolve, and how to evolve. We examine evolutionary mechanisms across agent components (e.g., models, memory, tools, architecture), categorize adaptation methods by stages (e.g., intra-test-time, inter-test-time), and analyze the algorithmic and architectural designs that guide evolutionary adaptation (e.g., scalar rewards, textual feedback, single-agent and multi-agent systems). Additionally, we analyze evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored for self-evolving agents, highlight applications in domains such as coding, education, and healthcare, and identify critical challenges and research directions in safety, scalability, and co-evolutionary dynamics. By providing a structured framework for understanding and designing self-evolving agents, this survey establishes a roadmap for advancing adaptive agentic systems in both research and real-world deployments, ultimately shedding lights to pave the way for the realization of Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI), where agents evolve autonomously, performing at or beyond human-level intelligence across a wide array of tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rep-MTL: Unleashing the Power of Representation-level Task Saliency for   Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21049</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.21049.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Zedong Wang, Siyuan Li, Dan Xu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 38&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Despite the promise of Multi-Task Learning in leveraging complementary knowledge across tasks, existing multi-task optimization (MTO) techniques remain fixated on resolving conflicts via optimizer-centric loss scaling and gradient manipulation strategies, yet fail to deliver consistent gains. In this paper, we argue that the shared representation space, where task interactions naturally occur, offers rich information and potential for operations complementary to existing optimizers, especially for facilitating the inter-task complementarity, which is rarely explored in MTO. This intuition leads to Rep-MTL, which exploits the representation-level task saliency to quantify interactions between task-specific optimization and shared representation learning. By steering these saliencies through entropy-based penalization and sample-wise cross-task alignment, Rep-MTL aims to mitigate negative transfer by maintaining the effective training of individual tasks instead pure conflict-solving, while explicitly promoting complementary information sharing. Experiments are conducted on four challenging MTL benchmarks covering both task-shift and domain-shift scenarios. The results show that Rep-MTL, even paired with the basic equal weighting policy, achieves competitive performance gains with favorable efficiency. Beyond standard performance metrics, Power Law exponent analysis demonstrates Rep-MTL's efficacy in balancing task-specific learning and cross-task sharing.

      <title>Evaluating Deep Learning Models for African Wildlife Image   Classification: From DenseNet to Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21364</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.21364.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Lukman Jibril Aliyu, Umar Sani Muhammad, Bilqisu Ismail, Nasiru Muhammad, Almustapha A Wakili, Seid Muhie Yimam, Shamsuddeen Hassan Muhammad, Mustapha Abdullahi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Wildlife populations in Africa face severe threats, with vertebrate numbers declining by over 65% in the past five decades. In response, image classification using deep learning has emerged as a promising tool for biodiversity monitoring and conservation. This paper presents a comparative study of deep learning models for automatically classifying African wildlife images, focusing on transfer learning with frozen feature extractors. Using a public dataset of four species: buffalo, elephant, rhinoceros, and zebra; we evaluate the performance of DenseNet-201, ResNet-152, EfficientNet-B4, and Vision Transformer ViT-H/14. DenseNet-201 achieved the best performance among convolutional networks (67% accuracy), while ViT-H/14 achieved the highest overall accuracy (99%), but with significantly higher computational cost, raising deployment concerns. Our experiments highlight the trade-offs between accuracy, resource requirements, and deployability. The best-performing CNN (DenseNet-201) was integrated into a Hugging Face Gradio Space for real-time field use, demonstrating the feasibility of deploying lightweight models in conservation settings. This work contributes to African-grounded AI research by offering practical insights into model selection, dataset preparation, and responsible deployment of deep learning tools for wildlife conservation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>BANG: Dividing 3D Assets via Generative Exploded Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21493</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.21493.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Longwen Zhang, Qixuan Zhang, Haoran Jiang, Yinuo Bai, Wei Yang, Lan Xu, Jingyi Yu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 56&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; 3D creation has always been a unique human strength, driven by our ability to deconstruct and reassemble objects using our eyes, mind and hand. However, current 3D design tools struggle to replicate this natural process, requiring considerable artistic expertise and manual labor. This paper introduces BANG, a novel generative approach that bridges 3D generation and reasoning, allowing for intuitive and flexible part-level decomposition of 3D objects. At the heart of BANG is "Generative Exploded Dynamics", which creates a smooth sequence of exploded states for an input geometry, progressively separating parts while preserving their geometric and semantic coherence.   BANG utilizes a pre-trained large-scale latent diffusion model, fine-tuned for exploded dynamics with a lightweight exploded view adapter, allowing precise control over the decomposition process. It also incorporates a temporal attention module to ensure smooth transitions and consistency across time. BANG enhances control with spatial prompts, such as bounding boxes and surface regions, enabling users to specify which parts to decompose and how. This interaction can be extended with multimodal models like GPT-4, enabling 2D-to-3D manipulations for more intuitive and creative workflows.   The capabilities of BANG extend to generating detailed part-level geometry, associating parts with functional descriptions, and facilitating component-aware 3D creation and manufacturing workflows. Additionally, BANG offers applications in 3D printing, where separable parts are generated for easy printing and reassembly. In essence, BANG enables seamless transformation from imaginative concepts to detailed 3D assets, offering a new perspective on creation that resonates with human intuition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MoHoBench: Assessing Honesty of Multimodal Large Language Models via   Unanswerable Visual Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21503</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.21503.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yanxu Zhu, Shitong Duan, Xiangxu Zhang, Jitao Sang, Peng Zhang, Tun Lu, Xiao Zhou, Jing Yao, Xiaoyuan Yi, Xing Xie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Recently Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved considerable advancements in vision-language tasks, yet produce potentially harmful or untrustworthy content. Despite substantial work investigating the trustworthiness of language models, MMLMs' capability to act honestly, especially when faced with visually unanswerable questions, remains largely underexplored. This work presents the first systematic assessment of honesty behaviors across various MLLMs. We ground honesty in models' response behaviors to unanswerable visual questions, define four representative types of such questions, and construct MoHoBench, a large-scale MMLM honest benchmark, consisting of 12k+ visual question samples, whose quality is guaranteed by multi-stage filtering and human verification. Using MoHoBench, we benchmarked the honesty of 28 popular MMLMs and conducted a comprehensive analysis. Our findings show that: (1) most models fail to appropriately refuse to answer when necessary, and (2) MMLMs' honesty is not solely a language modeling issue, but is deeply influenced by visual information, necessitating the development of dedicated methods for multimodal honesty alignment. Therefore, we implemented initial alignment methods using supervised and preference learning to improve honesty behavior, providing a foundation for future work on trustworthy MLLMs. Our data and code can be found at https://github.com/DSTTSD/MoHoBench.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Persona Vectors: Monitoring and Controlling Character Traits in Language   Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21509</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.21509.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Runjin Chen, Andy Arditi, Henry Sleight, Owain Evans, Jack Lindsey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 18&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Large language models interact with users through a simulated 'Assistant' persona. While the Assistant is typically trained to be helpful, harmless, and honest, it sometimes deviates from these ideals. In this paper, we identify directions in the model's activation space-persona vectors-underlying several traits, such as evil, sycophancy, and propensity to hallucinate. We confirm that these vectors can be used to monitor fluctuations in the Assistant's personality at deployment time. We then apply persona vectors to predict and control personality shifts that occur during training. We find that both intended and unintended personality changes after finetuning are strongly correlated with shifts along the relevant persona vectors. These shifts can be mitigated through post-hoc intervention, or avoided in the first place with a new preventative steering method. Moreover, persona vectors can be used to flag training data that will produce undesirable personality changes, both at the dataset level and the individual sample level. Our method for extracting persona vectors is automated and can be applied to any personality trait of interest, given only a natural-language description.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>TARS: MinMax Token-Adaptive Preference Strategy for Hallucination   Reduction in MLLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21584</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.21584.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Kejia Zhang, Keda Tao, Zhiming Luo, Chang Liu, Jiasheng Tang, Huan Wang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable vision-language reasoning, yet often generate plausible outputs that are factually incorrect or visually ungrounded, thereby compromising their reliability. Direct preference optimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by aligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies typically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on static supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to superficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional rigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant visual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a token-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max optimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under semantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously minimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations. This joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to preference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning. We evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently strong performance. Using only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback, TARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and decreases cognition value from 2.5 to 0.4. It outperforms standard DPO and matches GPT-4o on several key metrics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MixGRPO: Unlocking Flow-based GRPO Efficiency with Mixed ODE-SDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21802</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.21802.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Junzhe Li, Yutao Cui, Tao Huang, Yinping Ma, Chun Fan, Miles Yang, Zhao Zhong&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Although GRPO substantially enhances flow matching models in human preference alignment of image generation, methods such as FlowGRPO still exhibit inefficiency due to the necessity of sampling and optimizing over all denoising steps specified by the Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we propose MixGRPO, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed sampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential equations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the optimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost performance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence. Additionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in optimization, higher-order solvers are supported for sampling. So we present a faster variant, termed MixGRPO-Flash, which further improves training efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits substantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment, outperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50% lower training time. Notably, MixGRPO-Flash further reduces training time by 71%. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/MixGRPO{MixGRPO}.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Existing world generation approaches typically fall into two categories: video-based methods that offer rich diversity but lack 3D consistency and rendering efficiency, and 3D-based methods that provide geometric consistency but struggle with limited training data and memory-inefficient representations. To address these limitations, we present HunyuanWorld 1.0, a novel framework that combines the best of both worlds for generating immersive, explorable, and interactive 3D scenes from text and image conditions. Our approach features three key advantages: 1) 360{\deg} immersive experiences via panoramic world proxies; 2) mesh export capabilities for seamless compatibility with existing computer graphics pipelines; 3) disentangled object representations for augmented interactivity. The core of our framework is a semantically layered 3D mesh representation that leverages panoramic images as 360{\deg} world proxies for semantic-aware world decomposition and reconstruction, enabling the generation of diverse 3D worlds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating coherent, explorable, and interactive 3D worlds while enabling versatile applications in virtual reality, physical simulation, game development, and interactive content creation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, which relies on sparse reward rules, often encounters the issue of identical rewards within groups, leading to the advantage collapse problem. Existing works typically address this challenge from two perspectives: enforcing model reflection to enhance response diversity, and introducing internal feedback to augment the training signal (advantage). In this work, we begin by analyzing the limitations of model reflection and investigating the policy entropy of responses at the fine-grained sample level. Based on our experimental findings, we propose the EDGE-GRPO algorithm, which adopts Entropy-Driven Advantage and Guided Error Correction to effectively mitigate the problem of advantage collapse. Extensive experiments on several main reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.21990.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Zihan Zhao, Bo Chen, Ziping Wan, Lu Chen, Xuanze Lin, Shiyang Yu, Situo Zhang, Da Ma, Zichen Zhu, Danyang Zhang, Huayang Wang, Zhongyang Dai, Liyang Wen, Xin Chen, Kai Yu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 23&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; While large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive progress, their application in scientific domains such as chemistry remains hindered by shallow domain understanding and limited reasoning capabilities. In this work, we focus on the specific field of chemistry and develop a Chemical Reasoner LLM, ChemDFM-R. We first construct a comprehensive dataset of atomized knowledge points to enhance the model's understanding of the fundamental principles and logical structure of chemistry. Then, we propose a mix-sourced distillation strategy that integrates expert-curated knowledge with general-domain reasoning skills, followed by domain-specific reinforcement learning to enhance chemical reasoning. Experiments on diverse chemical benchmarks demonstrate that ChemDFM-R achieves state-of-the-art performance while providing interpretable, rationale-driven outputs. Further case studies illustrate how explicit reasoning chains significantly improve the reliability, transparency, and practical utility of the model in real-world human-AI collaboration scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>X-Omni: Reinforcement Learning Makes Discrete Autoregressive Image   Generative Models Great Again</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22058</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.22058.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Zigang Geng, Yibing Wang, Yeyao Ma, Chen Li, Yongming Rao, Shuyang Gu, Zhao Zhong, Qinglin Lu, Han Hu, Xiaosong Zhang, Linus, Di Wang, Jie Jiang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 34&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Numerous efforts have been made to extend the ``next token prediction'' paradigm to visual contents, aiming to create a unified approach for both image generation and understanding. Nevertheless, attempts to generate images through autoregressive modeling with discrete tokens have been plagued by issues such as low visual fidelity, distorted outputs, and failure to adhere to complex instructions when rendering intricate details. These shortcomings are likely attributed to cumulative errors during autoregressive inference or information loss incurred during the discretization process. Probably due to this challenge, recent research has increasingly shifted toward jointly training image generation with diffusion objectives and language generation with autoregressive objectives, moving away from unified modeling approaches. In this work, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning can effectively mitigate artifacts and largely enhance the generation quality of a discrete autoregressive modeling method, thereby enabling seamless integration of image and language generation. Our framework comprises a semantic image tokenizer, a unified autoregressive model for both language and images, and an offline diffusion decoder for image generation, termed X-Omni. X-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance in image generation tasks using a 7B language model, producing images with high aesthetic quality while exhibiting strong capabilities in following instructions and rendering long texts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MOVE: Motion-Guided Few-Shot Video Object Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22061</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.22061.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Kaining Ying, Hengrui Hu, Henghui Ding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; This work addresses motion-guided few-shot video object segmentation (FSVOS), which aims to segment dynamic objects in videos based on a few annotated examples with the same motion patterns. Existing FSVOS datasets and methods typically focus on object categories, which are static attributes that ignore the rich temporal dynamics in videos, limiting their application in scenarios requiring motion understanding. To fill this gap, we introduce MOVE, a large-scale dataset specifically designed for motion-guided FSVOS. Based on MOVE, we comprehensively evaluate 6 state-of-the-art methods from 3 different related tasks across 2 experimental settings. Our results reveal that current methods struggle to address motion-guided FSVOS, prompting us to analyze the associated challenges and propose a baseline method, Decoupled Motion Appearance Network (DMA). Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in few shot motion understanding, establishing a solid foundation for future research in this direction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Although CLIP is successfully trained on billion-scale image-text pairs from the English world, scaling CLIP's training further to learning from the worldwide web data is still challenging: (1) no curation method is available to handle data points from non-English world; (2) the English performance from existing multilingual CLIP is worse than its English-only counterpart, i.e., "curse of multilinguality" that is common in LLMs. Here, we present MetaCLIP 2, the first recipe training CLIP from scratch on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs. To generalize our findings, we conduct rigorous ablations with minimal changes that are necessary to address the above challenges and present a recipe enabling mutual benefits from English and non-English world data. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP 2 ViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%, and surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding factors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual benchmarks, such as CVQA with 57.4%, Babel-ImageNet with 50.2% and XM3600 with 64.3% on image-to-text retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Falcon-H1: A Family of Hybrid-Head Language Models Redefining Efficiency   and Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22448</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.22448.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Jingwei Zuo, Maksim Velikanov, Ilyas Chahed, Younes Belkada, Dhia Eddine Rhayem, Guillaume Kunsch, Hakim Hacid, Hamza Yous, Brahim Farhat, Ibrahim Khadraoui, Mugariya Farooq, Giulia Campesan, Ruxandra Cojocaru, Yasser Djilali, Shi Hu, Iheb Chaabane, Puneesh Khanna, Mohamed El Amine Seddik, Ngoc Dung Huynh, Phuc Le Khac, Leen AlQadi, Billel Mokeddem, Mohamed Chami, Abdalgader Abubaker, Mikhail Lubinets, Kacper Piskorski, Slim Frikha&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 58&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; In this report, we introduce Falcon-H1, a new series of large language models (LLMs) featuring hybrid architecture designs optimized for both high performance and efficiency across diverse use cases. Unlike earlier Falcon models built solely on Transformer or Mamba architectures, Falcon-H1 adopts a parallel hybrid approach that combines Transformer-based attention with State Space Models (SSMs), known for superior long-context memory and computational efficiency. We systematically revisited model design, data strategy, and training dynamics, challenging conventional practices in the field. Falcon-H1 is released in multiple configurations, including base and instruction-tuned variants at 0.5B, 1.5B, 1.5B-deep, 3B, 7B, and 34B parameters. Quantized instruction-tuned models are also available, totaling over 30 checkpoints on Hugging Face Hub. Falcon-H1 models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and exceptional parameter and training efficiency. The flagship Falcon-H1-34B matches or outperforms models up to 70B scale, such as Qwen3-32B, Qwen2.5-72B, and Llama3.3-70B, while using fewer parameters and less data. Smaller models show similar trends: the Falcon-H1-1.5B-Deep rivals current leading 7B-10B models, and Falcon-H1-0.5B performs comparably to typical 7B models from 2024. These models excel across reasoning, mathematics, multilingual tasks, instruction following, and scientific knowledge. With support for up to 256K context tokens and 18 languages, Falcon-H1 is suitable for a wide range of applications. All models are released under a permissive open-source license, underscoring our commitment to accessible and impactful AI research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Efficient Differentially Private Fine-Tuning of LLMs via Reinforcement   Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22565</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.22565.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Afshin Khadangi, Amir Sartipi, Igor Tchappi, Ramin Bahmani, Gilbert Fridgen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; The tension between data privacy and model utility has become the defining bottleneck for the practical deployment of large language models (LLMs) trained on sensitive corpora including healthcare. Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) guarantees formal privacy, yet it does so at a pronounced cost: gradients are forcibly clipped and perturbed with noise, degrading sample efficiency and final accuracy. Numerous variants have been proposed to soften this trade-off, but they all share a handicap: their control knobs are hard-coded, global, and oblivious to the evolving optimization landscape. Consequently, practitioners are forced either to over-spend privacy budget in pursuit of utility, or to accept mediocre models in order to stay within privacy constraints. We present RLDP, the first framework to cast DP optimization itself as a closed-loop control problem amenable to modern deep reinforcement learning (RL). RLDP continuously senses rich statistics of the learning dynamics and acts by selecting fine-grained per parameter gradient-clipping thresholds as well as the magnitude of injected Gaussian noise. A soft actor-critic (SAC) hyper-policy is trained online during language model fine-tuning; it learns, from scratch, how to allocate the privacy budget where it matters and when it matters. Across more than 1,600 ablation experiments on GPT2-small, Llama-1B, Llama-3B, and Mistral-7B, RLDP delivers perplexity reductions of 1.3-30.5% (mean 5.4%) and an average 5.6% downstream utility gain. RLDP reaches each baseline's final utility after only 13-43% of the gradient-update budget (mean speed-up 71%), all while honoring the same (epsilon, delta)-DP contract and exhibiting equal or lower susceptibility to membership-inference and canary-extraction attacks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>VL-Cogito: Progressive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning for Advanced   Multimodal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22607</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.22607.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ruifeng Yuan, Chenghao Xiao, Sicong Leng, Jianyu Wang, Long Li, Weiwen Xu, Hou Pong Chan, Deli Zhao, Tingyang Xu, Zhongyu Wei, Hao Zhang, Yu Rong&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 37&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Reinforcement learning has proven its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. Recent research efforts have progressively extended this paradigm to multimodal reasoning tasks. Due to the inherent complexity and diversity of multimodal tasks, especially in semantic content and problem formulations, existing models often exhibit unstable performance across various domains and difficulty levels. To address these limitations, we propose VL-Cogito, an advanced multimodal reasoning model trained via a novel multi-stage Progressive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (PCuRL) framework. PCuRL systematically guides the model through tasks of gradually increasing difficulty, substantially improving its reasoning abilities across diverse multimodal contexts. The framework introduces two key innovations: (1) an online difficulty soft weighting mechanism, dynamically adjusting training difficulty across successive RL training stages; and (2) a dynamic length reward mechanism, which encourages the model to adaptively regulate its reasoning path length according to task complexity, thus balancing reasoning efficiency with correctness. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that VL-Cogito consistently matches or surpasses existing reasoning-oriented models across mainstream multimodal benchmarks spanning mathematics, science, logic, and general understanding, validating the effectiveness of our approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ScreenCoder: Advancing Visual-to-Code Generation for Front-End   Automation via Modular Multimodal Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22827</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.22827.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yilei Jiang, Yaozhi Zheng, Yuxuan Wan, Jiaming Han, Qunzhong Wang, Michael R. Lyu, Xiangyu Yue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 77&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Automating the transformation of user interface (UI) designs into front-end code holds significant promise for accelerating software development and democratizing design workflows. While recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated progress in text-to-code generation, many existing approaches rely solely on natural language prompts, limiting their effectiveness in capturing spatial layout and visual design intent. In contrast, UI development in practice is inherently multimodal, often starting from visual sketches or mockups. To address this gap, we introduce a modular multi-agent framework that performs UI-to-code generation in three interpretable stages: grounding, planning, and generation. The grounding agent uses a vision-language model to detect and label UI components, the planning agent constructs a hierarchical layout using front-end engineering priors, and the generation agent produces HTML/CSS code via adaptive prompt-based synthesis. This design improves robustness, interpretability, and fidelity over end-to-end black-box methods. Furthermore, we extend the framework into a scalable data engine that automatically produces large-scale image-code pairs. Using these synthetic examples, we fine-tune and reinforce an open-source VLM, yielding notable gains in UI understanding and code quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in layout accuracy, structural coherence, and code correctness. Our code is made publicly available at https://github.com/leigest519/ScreenCoder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Repair-R1: Better Test Before Repair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22853</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.22853.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Haichuan Hu, Xiaochen Xie, Quanjun Zhang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; APR (Automated Program Repair) aims to automatically locate program defects, generate patches and validate the repairs. Existing techniques for APR are often combined with LLMs (Large Language Models), which leverages the code-related knowledge of LLMs to improve repair effectiveness. Current LLM-based APR methods typically utilize test cases only during the inference stage, adopting an iterative approach that performs repair first and validates it through test execution afterward. This conventional paradigm neglects two important aspects: the potential contribution of test cases in the training phase, and the possibility of leveraging testing prior to repair. To address this, we propose Repair-R1, which introduces test cases into the model's training phase and shifts test generation to precede repair. The model is required to first generate discriminative test cases that can distinguish defective behaviors, and then perform repair based on these tests. This enables the model to better locate defects and understand the underlying causes of defects, thereby improving repair effectiveness. We implement Repair-R1 with three different backbone models, using RL (reinforcement learning) to co-optimize test generation and bug repair. Experimental results on four widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of Repair-R1. Specially, compared to vanilla models, Repair-R1 improves repair success rate by 2.68\% to 48.29\%, test generation success rate by 16.38\% to 53.28\%, and test coverage by 0.78\% to 53.96\%.

However, most current industrial systems remain heavily reliant on historical co-occurrence patterns and log-fitting objectives, i.e., optimizing for past user interactions without explicitly modeling user intent. This log-fitting approach often leads to overfitting to narrow historical preferences, failing to capture users' evolving and latent interests. As a result, it reinforces filter bubbles and long-tail phenomena, ultimately harming user experience and threatening the sustainability of the whole recommendation ecosystem.   To address these challenges, we rethink the overall design paradigm of recommender systems and propose RecGPT, a next-generation framework that places user intent at the center of the recommendation pipeline. By integrating large language models (LLMs) into key stages of user interest mining, item retrieval, and explanation generation, RecGPT transforms log-fitting recommendation into an intent-centric process. To effectively align general-purpose LLMs to the above domain-specific recommendation tasks at scale, RecGPT incorporates a multi-stage training paradigm, which integrates reasoning-enhanced pre-alignment and self-training evolution, guided by a Human-LLM cooperative judge system. Currently, RecGPT has been fully deployed on the Taobao App. Online experiments demonstrate that RecGPT achieves consistent performance gains across stakeholders: users benefit from increased content diversity and satisfaction, merchants and the platform gain greater exposure and conversions. These comprehensive improvement results across all stakeholders validates that LLM-driven, intent-centric design can foster a more sustainable and mutually beneficial recommendation ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>C3: A Bilingual Benchmark for Spoken Dialogue Models Exploring   Challenges in Complex Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22968</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.22968.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Chengqian Ma, Wei Tao, Yiwen Guo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 20&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) have recently attracted significant attention for their ability to generate voice responses directly to users' spoken queries. Despite their increasing popularity, there exists a gap in research focused on comprehensively understanding their practical effectiveness in comprehending and emulating human conversations. This is especially true compared to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), which benefit from extensive benchmarking. Human voice interactions are inherently more complex than text due to characteristics unique to spoken dialogue. Ambiguity poses one challenge, stemming from semantic factors like polysemy, as well as phonological aspects such as heterograph, heteronyms, and stress patterns. Additionally, context-dependency, like omission, coreference, and multi-turn interaction, adds further complexity to human conversational dynamics. To illuminate the current state of SDM development and to address these challenges, we present a benchmark dataset in this paper, which comprises 1,079 instances in English and Chinese. Accompanied by an LLM-based evaluation method that closely aligns with human judgment, this dataset facilitates a comprehensive exploration of the performance of SDMs in tackling these practical challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

To extend the boundaries of RAVS and facilitate future research in this field, we propose Omnimodal Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (OmniAVS), a new dataset containing 2,098 videos and 59,458 multimodal referring expressions. OmniAVS stands out with three key innovations: (1) 8 types of multimodal expressions that flexibly combine text, speech, sound, and visual cues; (2) an emphasis on understanding audio content beyond just detecting their presence; and (3) the inclusion of complex reasoning and world knowledge in expressions. Furthermore, we introduce Omnimodal Instructed Segmentation Assistant (OISA), to address the challenges of multimodal reasoning and fine-grained understanding of audiovisual content in OmniAVS. OISA uses MLLM to comprehend complex cues and perform reasoning-based segmentation. Extensive experiments show that OISA outperforms existing methods on OmniAVS and achieves competitive results on other related tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Efficient Machine Unlearning via Influence Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23257</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.23257.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Jiawei Liu, Chenwang Wu, Defu Lian, Enhong Chen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Due to growing privacy concerns, machine unlearning, which aims at enabling machine learning models to ``forget" specific training data, has received increasing attention. Among existing methods, influence-based unlearning has emerged as a prominent approach due to its ability to estimate the impact of individual training samples on model parameters without retraining. However, this approach suffers from prohibitive computational overhead arising from the necessity to compute the Hessian matrix and its inverse across all training samples and parameters, rendering it impractical for large-scale models and scenarios involving frequent data deletion requests. This highlights the difficulty of forgetting. Inspired by cognitive science, which suggests that memorizing is easier than forgetting, this paper establishes a theoretical link between memorizing (incremental learning) and forgetting (unlearning). This connection allows machine unlearning to be addressed from the perspective of incremental learning. Unlike the time-consuming Hessian computations in unlearning (forgetting), incremental learning (memorizing) typically relies on more efficient gradient optimization, which supports the aforementioned cognitive theory. Based on this connection, we introduce the Influence Approximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm for efficient machine unlearning from the incremental perspective. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that IAU achieves a superior balance among removal guarantee, unlearning efficiency, and comparable model utility, while outperforming state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets and model architectures.

      <title>iLRM: An Iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23277</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.23277.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Gyeongjin Kang, Seungtae Nam, Xiangyu Sun, Sameh Khamis, Abdelrahman Mohamed, Eunbyung Park&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 22&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Feed-forward 3D modeling has emerged as a promising approach for rapid and high-quality 3D reconstruction. In particular, directly generating explicit 3D representations, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, has attracted significant attention due to its fast and high-quality rendering, as well as numerous applications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution increases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely used datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed. Notably, iLRM exhibits superior scalability, delivering significantly higher reconstruction quality under comparable computational cost by efficiently leveraging a larger number of input views.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>NeRF Is a Valuable Assistant for 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23374</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.23374.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Shuangkang Fang, I-Chao Shen, Takeo Igarashi, Yufeng Wang, ZeSheng Wang, Yi Yang, Wenrui Ding, Shuchang Zhou&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; We introduce NeRF-GS, a novel framework that jointly optimizes Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). This framework leverages the inherent continuous spatial representation of NeRF to mitigate several limitations of 3DGS, including sensitivity to Gaussian initialization, limited spatial awareness, and weak inter-Gaussian correlations, thereby enhancing its performance. In NeRF-GS, we revisit the design of 3DGS and progressively align its spatial features with NeRF, enabling both representations to be optimized within the same scene through shared 3D spatial information. We further address the formal distinctions between the two approaches by optimizing residual vectors for both implicit features and Gaussian positions to enhance the personalized capabilities of 3DGS. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that NeRF-GS surpasses existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This outcome confirms that NeRF and 3DGS are complementary rather than competing, offering new insights into hybrid approaches that combine 3DGS and NeRF for efficient 3D scene representation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Enhanced Arabic Text Retrieval with Attentive Relevance Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23404</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.23404.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Salah Eddine Bekhouche, Azeddine Benlamoudi, Yazid Bounab, Fadi Dornaika, Abdenour Hadid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Arabic poses a particular challenge for natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) due to its complex morphology, optional diacritics and the coexistence of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various dialects. Despite the growing global significance of Arabic, it is still underrepresented in NLP research and benchmark resources. In this paper, we present an enhanced Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) framework developed specifically for Arabic. At the core of our approach is a novel Attentive Relevance Scoring (ARS) that replaces standard interaction mechanisms with an adaptive scoring function that more effectively models the semantic relevance between questions and passages. Our method integrates pre-trained Arabic language models and architectural refinements to improve retrieval performance and significantly increase ranking accuracy when answering Arabic questions. The code is made publicly available at https://github.com/Bekhouche/APR{GitHub}.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Beyond Linear Bottlenecks: Spline-Based Knowledge Distillation for   Culturally Diverse Art Style Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23436</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.23436.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Abdellah Zakaria Sellam, Salah Eddine Bekhouche, Cosimo Distante, Abdelmalik Taleb-Ahmed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Art style classification remains a formidable challenge in computational aesthetics due to the scarcity of expertly labeled datasets and the intricate, often nonlinear interplay of stylistic elements. While recent dual-teacher self-supervised frameworks reduce reliance on labeled data, their linear projection layers and localized focus struggle to model global compositional context and complex style-feature interactions. We enhance the dual-teacher knowledge distillation framework to address these limitations by replacing conventional MLP projection and prediction heads with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). Our approach retains complementary guidance from two teacher networks, one emphasizing localized texture and brushstroke patterns, the other capturing broader stylistic hierarchies while leveraging KANs' spline-based activations to model nonlinear feature correlations with mathematical precision. Experiments on WikiArt and Pandora18k demonstrate that our approach outperforms the base dual teacher architecture in Top-1 accuracy. Our findings highlight the importance of KANs in disentangling complex style manifolds, leading to better linear probe accuracy than MLP projections.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On the Expressiveness of Softmax Attention: A Recurrent Neural Network   Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23632</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.23632.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Gabriel Mongaras, Eric C. Larson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Since its introduction, softmax attention has become the backbone of modern transformer architectures due to its expressiveness and scalability across a wide range of tasks. However, the main drawback of softmax attention is the quadratic memory requirement and computational complexity with respect to the sequence length. By replacing the softmax nonlinearity, linear attention and similar methods have been introduced to avoid the quadratic bottleneck of softmax attention. Despite these linear forms of attention being derived from the original softmax formulation, they typically lag in terms of downstream accuracy. While strong intuition of the softmax nonlinearity on the query and key inner product suggests that it has desirable properties compared to other nonlinearities, the question of why this discrepancy exists still remains unanswered. This work demonstrates that linear attention is an approximation of softmax attention by deriving the recurrent form of softmax attention. Using this form, each part of softmax attention can be described in the language of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Describing softmax attention as an RNN allows for the ablation of the components of softmax attention to understand the importance of each part and how they interact. In this way, our work helps explain why softmax attention is more expressive than its counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>villa-X: Enhancing Latent Action Modeling in Vision-Language-Action   Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23682</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.23682.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Xiaoyu Chen, Hangxing Wei, Pushi Zhang, Chuheng Zhang, Kaixin Wang, Yanjiang Guo, Rushuai Yang, Yucen Wang, Xinquan Xiao, Li Zhao, Jianyu Chen, Jiang Bian&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 20&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a popular paradigm for learning robot manipulation policies that can follow language instructions and generalize to novel scenarios. Recent work has begun to explore the incorporation of latent actions, an abstract representation of visual change between two frames, into VLA pre-training. In this paper, we introduce villa-X, a novel Visual-Language-Latent-Action (ViLLA) framework that advances latent action modeling for learning generalizable robot manipulation policies. Our approach improves both how latent actions are learned and how they are incorporated into VLA pre-training. Together, these contributions enable villa-X to achieve superior performance across simulated environments including SIMPLER and LIBERO, as well as on two real-world robot setups including gripper and dexterous hand manipulation. We believe the ViLLA paradigm holds significant promise, and that our villa-X provides a strong foundation for future research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Scalable Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning for Generalizable Spatial   Intelligence in Visuomotor Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23698</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.23698.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Shaofei Cai, Zhancun Mu, Haiwen Xia, Bowei Zhang, Anji Liu, Yitao Liang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in language modeling, its triumph hasn't yet fully translated to visuomotor agents. A primary challenge in RL models is their tendency to overfit specific tasks or environments, thereby hindering the acquisition of generalizable behaviors across diverse settings. This paper provides a preliminary answer to this challenge by demonstrating that RL-finetuned visuomotor agents in Minecraft can achieve zero-shot generalization to unseen worlds. Specifically, we explore RL's potential to enhance generalizable spatial reasoning and interaction capabilities in 3D worlds. To address challenges in multi-task RL representation, we analyze and establish cross-view goal specification as a unified multi-task goal space for visuomotor policies. Furthermore, to overcome the significant bottleneck of manual task design, we propose automated task synthesis within the highly customizable Minecraft environment for large-scale multi-task RL training, and we construct an efficient distributed RL framework to support this. Experimental results show RL significantly boosts interaction success rates by 4times and enables zero-shot generalization of spatial reasoning across diverse environments, including real-world settings. Our findings underscore the immense potential of RL training in 3D simulated environments, especially those amenable to large-scale task generation, for significantly advancing visuomotor agents' spatial reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Seed-Prover: Deep and Broad Reasoning for Automated Theorem Proving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23726</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.23726.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Luoxin Chen, Jinming Gu, Liankai Huang, Wenhao Huang, Zhicheng Jiang, Allan Jie, Xiaoran Jin, Xing Jin, Chenggang Li, Kaijing Ma, Cheng Ren, Jiawei Shen, Wenlei Shi, Tong Sun, He Sun, Jiahui Wang, Siran Wang, Zhihong Wang, Chenrui Wei, Shufa Wei, Yonghui Wu, Yuchen Wu, Yihang Xia, Huajian Xin, Fan Yang, Huaiyuan Ying, Hongyi Yuan, Zheng Yuan, Tianyang Zhan, Chi Zhang, Yue Zhang, Ge Zhang, Tianyun Zhao, Jianqiu Zhao, Yichi Zhou, Thomas Hanwen Zhu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 87&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose Seed-Prover, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning. Seed-Prover proves 78.1% of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F, and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine Seed-Geometry, which outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long chain-of-thought reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Phi-Ground Tech Report: Advancing Perception in GUI Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23779</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2507.23779.png" alt="Paper thumbnail" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Miaosen Zhang, Ziqiang Xu, Jialiang Zhu, Qi Dai, Kai Qiu, Yifan Yang, Chong Luo, Tianyi Chen, Justin Wagle, Tim Franklin, Baining Guo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upvotes:&lt;/b&gt; 37&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt; With the development of multimodal reasoning models, Computer Use Agents (CUAs), akin to Jarvis from "Iron Man", are becoming a reality. GUI grounding is a core component for CUAs to execute actual actions, similar to mechanical control in robotics, and it directly leads to the success or failure of the system. It determines actions such as clicking and typing, as well as related parameters like the coordinates for clicks. Current end-to-end grounding models still achieve less than 65\% accuracy on challenging benchmarks like ScreenSpot-pro and UI-Vision, indicating they are far from being ready for deployment. % , as a single misclick can result in unacceptable consequences. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the training of grounding models, examining details from data collection to model training. Ultimately, we developed the Phi-Ground model family, which achieves state-of-the-art performance across all five grounding benchmarks for models under 10B parameters in agent settings. In the end-to-end model setting, our model still achieves SOTA results with scores of \textbf{43.2} on ScreenSpot-pro and \textbf{27.2} on UI-Vision. We believe that the various details discussed in this paper, along with our successes and failures, not only clarify the construction of grounding models but also benefit other perception tasks.
